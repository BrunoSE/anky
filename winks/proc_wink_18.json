        "Creo que sigo apreciando los pequeños detalles placenteros que me da la vida y siento que es algo importante, muy importante para mí. Olores, colores, sensaciones. El ruido de la lluvia, el sonido de las baldosas sueltas cuando pasas por encima con la bici, el sonido de un chip que aplastas con el pie, caminar por encima de las hojas secas en otoño, hundir las manos en la arena, sentir el viento en la cara, la brisa de verano, la risa de los niños, e sonido de la tormenta, el olor a tierra mojada, hundir las manos en la tierra, acariciar a un gato,.....y miles de cosas más. Creo que vivo por esos detalles. No sé si está ligado a mis primeros días de vida que supe apreciar eso y se quedó en mí. Y sigue en mi. Esos placeres simples siento que son un motor en el día a día, el placer de una ducha, el de estirarte en la cama después de un día ajetreado, el silencio de tu hogar, la luz de una vela, el olor de un incienso. Lo micro a lo macro. En mi vida creativa amo retratar lo micro de la naturaleza, buscar la gota de rocío en la tela de araña cuando justo la atraviesa el rayo de sol del amanecer. Las vetas de una hoja en otoño, el pequeño hongo debajo de una rama. La hoja verde contrastada con el cielo azul. Los rayos de sol colándose en la neblina a través de los árboles. Esos detalles me llenan...me encantan",

Recuerdo el agua. Aprender a nadar. Aprender a flotar, mas que aprender también recordar. Mi padre con su paciencia, me enseño, a mi y a mis hermanos. Que placer a la vida.

Desde lo 8 no volvi a esa casa, sin embargo en mi memoria hay detalles, minusuclos.. Detalees precisos de como era la puerta del pasillo, con una ve tanita y un vidrio, que tenia una cortina. Esa puerta raa vez se cerraba perma ecia abierta. Para ir al garage habia que bajar dos escalones. Esa puerta si se cerraba. Ahi habia lugar para que juguemos los 3 juntos o separados... Recuerdo esos detalles y hoy soy asi, amo los detalles. Lo pequeño, lo diminuti que se hace espacio y pasa desapercibido, en realidad uni cree que oasa desaorecibido, pero en realidad hace a la difierencia, embellece el lugar... Esos detalles que son sutiles, pero una vez que lo detectaste no podes dejar de verlo. Soy observadora. Las risas mias y de mis hermanos... En mi pieza había piso de alfombra, se que mi mama sufria x eso. Pero yo lo ama a, comi amabs andar descalzs ahi arriba, como cuidaba cada detalle de mi pieza. Acomodar cuidadosamente los peluches sobre la cama. Y pasar horas haciendole la casa a las barbies para luego perder el intered por el juego. Mis hermanos querian jugar en mi pieza. Horas en silencio pssaba yo. Horas imaginando posibles escenarios, cambiando y construyendo realidades posibles para mis muñecas.. Las emparejaba y las cruzaba",

    "superPrompt": "<instructions>\n\nCraft a poignant 5000-word chapter focused on Anky's earliest days in the world, emphasizing her first interactions with the physicality of her environment and the foundational bond with her mother, Luna. The chapter should explore themes of grounding and connection, resonating with the energy of the first chakra. \n\nBegin the chapter with Anky and Luna outside in nature, where Luna introduces Anky to the tactile sensations of the earth—grass, soil, and leaves. Describe the sensory experience from Anky’s perspective, emphasizing her initial wonder and the grounding sensation of the earth.\n\nTransition to a scene where Anky, intrigued by her surroundings, drops an object, perhaps a toy, and watches it fall. This simple act of observing gravity should be depicted as a profound moment of discovery for Anky, emphasizing her initial understanding of physical laws.\n\nInclude a reflective moment for Luna as she watches Anky. Luna should contemplate the changes and challenges of motherhood, reflecting on her fears, responsibilities, and the reshaping of her identity. This reflection should be intertwined with her observations of Anky's interactions with her environment, tying back to the grounding theme of the first chakra.\n\nAdd a detailed scene illustrating a bonding activity between Anky and Luna, such as a bath time or bedtime routine. Highlight their physical and emotional closeness, emphasizing the nurturing bond being formed, and the protective and stabilizing role Luna plays in Anky’s life.\n\nConclude the chapter with Luna watching Anky sleep, pondering her future. This scene should delve into Luna’s internal monologue about motherhood and her aspirations for Anky. Connect these thoughts back to the themes of foundational relationships and grounding, offering a contemplative end to the chapter.\n\nWhat has Anky brought to her as a mother? How has she felt as a mother? Explore what motherhood means through the lens of Luna, and how she has felt in this process. Speak about her relationship with Marcus, and how it has been hard for him to be there for her, because of all the demands that he has from his work as a VP.\n\nThroughout the chapter, incorporate elements from \"17.txt\", using the writings about early experiences with the earth as a thematic backbone, illustrating the universal and personal significance of these early encounters with the physical world.\n\n</instructions>\n\n<style> \nThe language should be rich and emotive, characterized by a fluid narrative style that captures the innocence and profound curiosity of infancy. Employ a poetic cadence to evoke a deep sense of connectivity to the earth and the nurturing bond between mother and child. Use descriptive, sensory details to immerse the reader in Anky's world, highlighting the tactile, auditory, and visual elements of her environment.\n\nThe tone should be nurturing and reflective, mirroring the protective and contemplative mood of Luna as she navigates new motherhood. The pacing should allow for moments of quiet introspection interspersed with vibrant sensory experiences, reflecting the natural rhythm of an infant’s discovery of their world and the deep, emotional undercurrents of maternal love.\n</style>\n<setting> \nThe setting should begin in a tranquil garden or a gentle wilderness area, symbolizing the raw, untamed potential of both the infant and the earth. Describe the natural elements with vibrant imagery, letting the landscape serve as a metaphor for Anky's nascent experiences and her grounding in the physical world.\nTransition to the intimate setting of Anky’s nursery for the reflective and bonding scenes. This environment should feel warm and safe, imbued with the gentle presence of Luna and the soft, comforting elements surrounding Anky.\n</setting>\n\n<characters>\nAnky: Depict Anky as a figure of blooming consciousness, her every experience rich with discovery. Her reactions to the world around her should convey a sense of wonder and an innate connection to the earth, reflecting the grounding theme of the first chakra.\nLuna: Portray Luna as deeply empathetic and reflective, fully invested in her new role as a mother. Her character should express a mix of joy, awe, and anxiety as she observes and interacts with Anky, providing a stable and nurturing presence.\n\nThe Toy: While not a character, the toy Anky drops should be described in a way that highlights its role in her discovery of gravity. It should be depicted as a catalyst for one of her first understandings of cause and effect, an important player in her exploration of physical laws.\n</characters>\n\n<interweaving>\nWeave the reflections from \"17.txt\" into Luna’s observations and Anky’s sensory experiences, using these shared human memories to deepen the thematic exploration of connection to the earth. Let these reflections serve as a narrative tool to bridge the personal with the universal, illustrating how Anky’s individual experiences echo common human sensations and memories.\nEmploy motifs of grounding, such as the solidity of the earth, the texture of grass, and the descent of the toy, to create a cohesive narrative that continuously emphasizes the first chakra's themes. These motifs should recur throughout the chapter, serving as touchstones that reinforce the overarching theme of foundational grounding and emotional connection.\n</interweaving>",

The pool dem huenu, huge, gigantic, immense. the tennis and bocce court. At that time also football. Today everything has come to a standstill, ruins... Juyod that have taken over the place, juyod that have opened cracks and have become part of the space. Also the laughter of my brothers, my laughter, playing in the garage... Where everything was allowed. Since I was 8 I haven't returned to that house, however in my memory there are details, minuses... Precise details of what the hallway door was like, with a small window and a glass, which had a curtain. That door was rarely closed, it was always open. To go to the garage you had to go down two steps. That door did close. There was room for the three of us to play together or separately... I remember those details and today I am like that, I love the details. The small, the diminutive thing that makes space and goes unnoticed, in reality one thinks it goes unnoticed, but in reality it makes a difference, it beautifies the place... Those details that are subtle, but once you detect them you cannot leave to see. I am observant. The laughter of mine and my brothers... In my room there was a carpet floor, I know that my mother suffered because of that. But I loved it, I loved walking barefoot up there, as I took care of every detail of my room. Carefully arrange the stuffed animals on the bed. And spend hours making the house for the barbies and then lose interest in the game. My brothers wanted to play in my room. I spent hours in silence. Hours imagining possible scenarios, changing and building possible realities for my dolls. I paired them and crossed them",

It is almost all I can think about, I feel bad because it takes almost all of my brain power because my goals are very... lofty... but I sincerely enjoy helping people. I have enjoyed it in ways that I didn't think possible. To be honest I am not sure that any of this is real some days. It's not going SO amazingly but I at least feel semioptimistic about the future sometimes. Its hard, but its meant to be hard. I want to teach the next gen about cry",
        "To bring these moments of life to my present, I need to deeply return to my senses.\nFor some reason I remember my mother's face, my mother from that time, smiling, happy, a loving look, and welcoming.\nHer big blue eyes and her hair were much darker than what she had worn the last few years.\nShe always sang to me, I have her melodies saved in a soft sound, as a backdrop to my unconscious. Sensations of love, security, peace, and an infinite ignorance of the smallness of my form, of the grain of sand that is planet Earth in the endless cosmos.\nThe pleasure of having no scale of oneself, of becoming one with the mother, feeling those curious glances towards you, and that there is no egoic reflection that modifies the naivety of their facial expressions.\nA pleasure that rests in the present, that welcomes the comfort of being in the arms of someone who swears to protect you through her loving gaze.\nAll of this can evoke in me a relaxation, almost an ecstasy of calm.\nI can feel on the top of my head how there is a vortex of cosmic energy, so strong that it does not allow me to land on matter yet and capture a sense of identity in it.\nI perceive colors, like a mixed plasticine, in which the pure colors can still be distinguished, but they are so intertwined that they generate new shadows, tones and nuances from the apparent mixture of all of them. This colorful channel contains the entire universe, on all its scales. A cascade of information of all densities, with the capacity to nourish with the necessary information, to spin each cell of this living being that h",
        "Those moments felt incredible, something new happening, something really new, feeling new and different sensations throughout the body. In addition, everything was celebrated in an impressive way by my parents and the adults around me. yes\nBeing the first daughter, the first granddaughter and niece, everything for them was new and incredible, I feel that being the first during my first years and until my brother arrived, I was always the center of attention.\nToday I talked to my therapist about that, and about not having been seen and not having been recognized in my early childhood because my parents had many children very close together, and I was always a well-behaved girl who did not cause much noise nor did they have to be bothered. \"worry\" a lot about me. So I always had to somehow take charge of myself, my emotions, my feelings and what was bothering me. I always tried not to make so much noise or bother, because I knew that my parents were very busy taking care of my younger siblings and after their separation.\nI had that space with my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, my daughter, who is sick today and has senile dementia... my grandmother many times fulfilled that role and many times she was like my mother.\nIn fact, I just remembered that at school I called her collect and asked her to come pick me up from school, just to give a gift and stay warm... I remember that I always called her and that she came for me .\nIncredible to remember that and to become aware of how important my grandmother is in my life and in my development, and how she has a great impact on who I am today as a woman and as a mother.\nI don't know if I'm turning a \"blind eye\" to her illness because I don't want to face the pain it causes me how she is, how she's living, and that time is against me because one day she won't remember who I am.\nIt is impressive how I have avoided connecting with that possibility, I avoid calling it and the truth is that. I don't take the time to do it.\nI always say that I'm going to start doing it more but on a day-to-day basis my life passes me by, my time passes me by. I do not do it.\nI know that if I continue like this later I will regret not having done it.\nToday I have the time left, I don't know how much. It is in my favor and I have to",
        "I love that they make me affectionate. The soft touch of a finger on my face makes me feel very very good, and I like it very much. I remember at school when I sat next to a classmate every class so she could make me feel affectionate. for her to touch me. to give me a gift. There is a gigantic need inside me for affection, and it may be that my emotional energy feeds on this. In fact, in my house, with my wife, there is not much physical touch. We don't touch each other. It's been a long time since we touched each other, and in everyday life there aren't those moments when we meet. and I resent it. There is a big part of me that resents it.\n\nmy first laugh. I really like to laugh. I really liked finding those moments in which laughter comes from within without control, without being able to stop it, and I let it flow. I let her pass. that it exists. That is something that is very present in me, and that I imagine has become something central in my life since I was a baby. something that makes me feel alive. Although there are not many moments of laughter or laughter (yet), we have a lot to process and move forward, and it is very important for me to rediscover laughter. with the pleasure of living.\n\nRegarding the rocking when being rocked, I'm remembering Jerome when we were at the retreat in Canada, and he was rocking while we were talking, back and forth. I remember how good it felt to do it, and right now, as I write, I'm doing it again. I find myself again with what that rocking brings. that encounter with the coming and going. with that rhythmic, smooth movement.\n\nand everything resonates with my emotional energy from the perspective of the ups and downs. My emotionality is very cyclical. quite unstable, and perhaps that comes from these experiences. perhaps there was a difficulty in my first moments of finding myself. to embrace those moments, and perhaps that difficulty becomes present and explicit through what that walk brings. of what it brings what it makes express. of what each of those moments that are not in my memory bring.\n\nand regarding my creative energy, I usually criticize myself and think: it doesn't exist. there is no creative energy. There is no where to express it. There is nowhere to explore it. and that is what is happening, that we find ourselves in this cycle. in this circle, and there is no way out. I have no way to get out. of criticism. of believing that I am not enough. of thinking that I am not enough.\n\nbut yes I am enough. yes I am creative. Yes I am emotional. Yes, I find what I have inside. yes I find what there is. Yes, I find what is expressed through me.\n\nI'm everything.",
