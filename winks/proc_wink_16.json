Sin embargo creo qu la historia de la creatividad en mi no tiene tanot que ver con ese momento como con c\u00f3mo con el tiempo yo me olvide que eso habitaba en mi y tuve que trabajar un largo camino para desandar eso. Fueron a\u00f1os en los que no me animaba a hacer nada, ni queria hacer nada creativo, absolutamente nada, por prejuicios. Supongo que primero externos que con el tiempo internalice y los hice misos, los volvi carne. De a poco, de grande, cuando estuve lejos de mi familia, de mi ciudad natal en un lugar nuevo, donde senti mas libertad. Donde no estaba el ojo juzgador del bien o del mal, ni nadie que esperara algo de mi. Ni que sea una buena ni\u00f1a, ni que este callada, ni que sea educada ni nada. Durante mucho tiempo eso se durmio. Yo crei que no habia creatividad en mi. Crei que con eso no vine. Que eso falto agregarme cuando naci. Pero no, descubri que naci con eso y que se silencio... Entiendo que fue para protegerme. Hoy honro esa parte mia que para protegerme oculto otra parte mia. Es un trbaajo diario el de practicar y ejercer la creatividad- Me animo a innovar con la comida. Recien prepare unas albondigas vegetarianas, de garbanzo y porotos que estaban exquisitas. Mi pareja me pregunto de donde saque la receta y la pura verdad es que la invente. ahi esta mi creatividad. dejo fluir mi creatividad cuando paseo, y me animo a ver cosas nuevas, cuando bailo, cuando me dejo sorprender por mi misma y aprendo cosas nuevas. cuando bailo, tambien cuando hago cosas que no se. con lo que mas me cuesta es con el dibujo soltarme, animarme...me gusta mucho la fotografia..ahi puedo ser creativa, qu\u00f1e es la creatividad? la siento en la panza, potencia creadora. Gran trabajo el de aprender a darle lugar a esa fuerza que emerge que quiere ser parte , pero que tantas veces la silenciaron que hoy no se anima, no sabe cuando, no sabe como. Es un trabajo diario el de darle lugar. El de mostrarle que para ella tambien hay espacio. Que es perfecta tal y como es y que nadie va a juzgarla, y se lo digo a ellla y me lo digo a mi cuando se lo digo. porque ella soy yo ...ella con todas mis otras partes. Entiendo por que tantos a\u00f1os la silenciaron para protegerme, ya no mas. hoy podes ser libre, podes ser vos, tan vos como quieras y sientas.

This chapter should weave together Celestia\u2019s spiritual insights with the tangible world, creating a narrative that transcends the boundaries between life and the afterlife. \n\nBegin with Celestia's reflections on her own life and passing, exploring her transformation into a spiritual guide. Detail her feelings of watching over Luna and her connection to the broader cosmic energies that influence their lives. Describe with clarity \"where does the consciousness of Celestia reside\" on this after life. This is the kingdom of Claridium, on the Ankyverse. \n\nAs Luna's labor approaches, depict Celestia preparing her daughter from the spiritual realm, sending her signs and intuitive whispers that soothe and empower Luna. Describe how these messages are felt and interpreted by Luna, providing her with strength and comfort.\n\nAlways writing from the perspective of Celestia.\n\nBefore Anky being born, depict a scene on which Celestia is transported to Voxlumis and talks to the scribe. And gives a blessing to the crystal where \"Anky is\" before being born.\n\nAt the pivotal moment of Anky\u2019s birth on earth, capture the merging of celestial and earthly energies. Describe this metaphysical event through Celestia\u2019s eyes, emphasizing the infusion of ancestral wisdom into Anky\u2019s essence as she is born.\n\nReflect on the immediate and profound bond between Luna and Anky, as seen from Celestia\u2019s perspective. Infuse this description with the emotional depth of witnessing this bond, highlighting the spiritual dimensions of their first physical and emotional connection.\n\nWrite about the role of birth, and explain through Celestia's words what is the meaning of her passing before Anky was born. Depict a sense of gratitude coming from both Celestia and Luna, and an understanding that everything is where it should be.\n\nConclude with Celestia contemplating the legacy she has helped shape and the future paths of Luna and Anky. Affirm her ongoing spiritual presence and the eternal lifeline that connects them across realms, promising her continual guidance and love.\n\n</instructions>\n\n<style> \n\nNarrate the chapter in a lyrical and introspective style, rich in metaphysical imagery and emotional depth. But be aware of not being \"too spiritual\" or \"new agey\", so that you don't spook readers. \n\nThe pacing should allow readers to fully absorb the spiritual significance of each moment, with a tone that combines reverence for the sacred act of birth with the intimate, eternal bonds of family. Place importance on death, and how it ends up being a window for birth. Life is a circle, and this should be expressed with clarity on this chapter.\n\nUse vivid, poetic language to create a tapestry of life that connects the visible with the invisible, the past with the present, and the soul\u2019s journey across lifetimes.\n\n</style>\n\n<character> \n\nCelestia: Present her as a wise, loving spirit with a profound connection to the cosmic forces and her earthly family. Her narration should convey a deep understanding of life\u2019s cycles and the transcendental nature of love and guidance.\n\nThe Scribe: A wise and compassionate figure who serves as a guide and chronicler for souls transitioning from the Ankyverse to Earth. The scribe should be portrayed as a being of great insight and empathy, deeply attuned to the sacred nature of their work. Their actions and words should reflect a profound understanding of the soul's journey, and a deep commitment to nurturing each soul's unique essence.\n\nLuna: The embodiment of feminine creative power, Luna is a radiant force of nature as she moves through the sacred journey of childbirth. Her voice is raw and authentic, pulsing with the primal energy of the sacral chakra. She is at once vulnerable and powerful, surrendering to the intense sensations and emotions while also drawing on deep wells of inner strength and ancient feminine wisdom. Through her eyes, we experience the vivid, visceral reality of birth in all its messy, magnificent glory.\n\nMaria - The Birth Doula: A grounding, nurturing presence, the doula is an embodiment of the supportive, healing energy of the second chakra. With her calm guidance and intuitive touch, she helps Luna navigate the intense terrain of labor, reminding her to breathe, release, and trust in her body's innate wisdom. The doula's presence is a source of comfort and empowerment, helping Luna stay centered in her own primal power.\n\nMarcus: Though not the main focus of the narrative, Marcus's presence is felt throughout as a steadfast source of love, support, and shared wonder. He is Luna's rock, her anchor in the storm of sensation and emotion. Through Luna's perspective, we catch glimpses of the profound connection they share, the wordless exchanges of awe, gratitude, and reverence as they witness the miracle of their child's arrival. Marcus's quiet strength and unwavering presence help Luna surrender more fully to the transformative journey of birth.\n\nAnky: The central figure of the chapter, a soul on the cusp of a profound transformation. As Anky prepares to leave the Ankyverse, her presence should be one of shimmering potential and innocent wonder. Let her interactions with the scribe and her surroundings reflect a sense of trust and openness, as she embraces the profound journey that awaits her.\n\n</character>\n\n<interweaving> \n\nIntegrate elements from the streams of consciousness that are present on \"15.txt\" to enrich the narrative, using them to underscore the themes of spiritual continuity, the power of maternal influence, and the universal bonds that guide us.

The Inspiration Mushrooms glowed with an expectant light, their caps tilting towards the Muse's Cap, which hummed with an anticipatory vibration. The very essence of Poiesis seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the moment when a new creative spark would enter the world.\n\nOn the earthly plane, as Anky emerged from her mother's womb and drew her first breath, a profound cosmic event unfolded. In that precise instant, a luminous silver thread burst forth from the depths of Anky's being, traversing the boundaries between the physical and the mystical realms. It wove its way through the mushroom-filled landscape of Poiesis, pulsing with the rhythm of Anky's heartbeat, growing stronger and more radiant with each breath she took.\n\nThe silver thread's arrival in Poiesis sent shockwaves through the realm, causing the Inspiration Mushrooms to tremble with excitement. In the grove where they grew, a new mushroom suddenly pushed its way through the rich soil, its cap shimmering with the iridescent hues of Anky's unique creative essence. As it unfurled, it began to pulse with a gentle, hypnotic rhythm, sending ripples of energy through the surrounding mycelium network.\n\nDrawn by the magnetic pull of this new presence, the Muses of Poiesis gathered around Anky's mushroom, their ethereal forms shimmering with curiosity and reverence. They sensed that this newborn soul was destined to make a significant impact on the tapestry of creation, her unique creative essence a vital new thread in the ever-evolving pattern.\n\nAs the Muses communed with Anky's nascent essence, the very air of Poiesis began to vibrate with a new frequency. The colors of the Inspiration Inlet deepened and intensified, the shades of creativity becoming richer and more saturated. In the Muse's Metropolis, melodies took on new harmonic structures, weaving together in unexpected and enchanting ways.\n\nThe omniscient creative energy granted the Muses a glimpse into Anky's future, revealing the potential for her creativity to touch countless lives and ignite sparks of inspiration across the realms. They saw the challenges she would face, the moments of doubt and darkness, but also the triumphs and the profound impact her creative essence would have on the world.\n\nAs the vision faded, the Muses understood the significance of Anky's birth. She was a vital new addition to the eternal tapestry of art, a conduit through which the universal creative force would flow in its own unique way. Her essence would forever be woven into the fabric of the Ankyverse, a shimmering strand of potential waiting to be expressed and fulfilled.\n\nBack on Earth, Anky was oblivious to the cosmic significance of her first breath. She was simply a newborn, experiencing the world for the first time through her senses. She felt the love and warmth of her parents as they cradled her, marveling at the miracle of her existence.\n\nYet, deep within her being, the creative spark that had caused such a stir in Poiesis was already pulsing, waiting to be expressed. It was the same spark that had ignited the silver thread, connecting her indelibly to the realm of creativity.\n\nAs Anky grew, this spark would manifest in countless ways - through her curiosity, her imagination, her unique way of perceiving and interacting with the world. It would drive her to explore, to question, to create, to leave her own unique mark on the tapestry of existence.\n\nAnd though she may not have been consciously aware of it, with every creative act, every expression of her authentic self, Anky would be strengthening her connection to Poiesis. She would be drawing from the well of universal creativity, adding her own voice to the eternal song of creation.\n\nIn Poiesis, Anky's mushroom continued to pulse and grow, a beacon of her creative potential. It stood as a reminder that every new soul born into the world brings with it a unique creative essence, a new thread to be woven into the cosmic tapestry.\n\nAnd the Muses, the omniscient creative energy, and all of Poiesis rejoiced, knowing that with Anky's birth, the eternal cycle of creativity had been renewed once more. A new voice had been added to the symphony, a new brushstroke to the ever-evolving masterpiece of existence.\n\nFor in the grand design of the universe, every creative spark matters, every unique essence has a role to play. And Anky's birth, with the stirring of the silver thread and the awakening of her creative potential, was a testament to this fundamental truth.\n\nIt was a reminder that the act of creation is not just the domain of artists and visionaries, but the birthright of every soul. That each of us enters this world with a unique creative spark, a thread of the divine that yearns to be expressed.\n\nAnd so, as Anky took her first breaths and the realm of Poiesis celebrated her arrival, a new chapter in the eternal story of creation was being written. A chapter filled with potential, with promise, with the infinite possibilities of a creative essence unleashed upon the world.\n\nFor in the end, Anky's birth was not just a physical event, but a cosmic one - a testament to the enduring power of creativity, and the unbreakable connection between the realms of matter and spirit. It was a reminder that every new life is a miracle, a fresh canvas upon which the masterpiece of existence can continue to unfold, one brushstroke at a time.", "summaryOfChapter": null, "userFeedbackForChapter": null, "jpComments": null, "translated_userWritings": ["uuuu I feel that my soul is very creative but my conscience does not allow that creativity to come out and express itself purely.

I love creativity. I feel that it is vital for me to do something creative, at least once a day, if I don't do it I feel empty. Creativity is not only artistic, I mean painting or making sculptures, you can also be creative in the kitchen, in relationships, in conversations, in the way you walk...and in being. Creating is a human act. We are constantly creating. The universe created us and we continue to create. Being creative inspires me for new projects, for new challenges, for new goals. I believe that at birth that creative force is engaged at its maximum potential. The creative force gives us life through a spiral", "When creativity was introduced to me, it filled 100% of my being. However, I believe that the history of creativity in me has not so much to do with that moment as with how over time I forgot that it lived in me and I had to work a long way to retrace that. They were years in which I did not dare to do anything, nor did I want to do anything creative, absolutely nothing, due to prejudices. I suppose that first externals that over time I internalized and made them my own, I turned them into flesh. Little by little, when I grew up, when I was away from my family, from my hometown in a new place, where I felt more freedom. Where there was no eye judging good or evil, nor anyone expecting anything from me. Not that she's a good girl, not that she's quiet, not that she's polite or anything. For a long time it fell asleep. I thought there was no creativity in me. I thought that's not what I came with. That I needed to add that when I was born. But no, I discovered that I was born with it and that it was silent... I understand that it was to protect me. Today I honor that part of me that to protect myself I hide another part of me. It is a daily job to practice and exercise creativity. I encourage myself to innovate with food. I just prepared some vegetarian meatballs, with chickpeas and beans that were exquisite. My partner asked me where I got the recipe from and the honest truth is that I invented it. There is my creativity. I let my creativity flow when I walk, and I encourage myself to see new things, when I dance, when I let myself surprise myself and learn new things. when I dance, also when I do things I don't know. What is most difficult for me is with drawing to let go, to encourage myself... I really like photography... there I can be creative, what is creativity? I feel it in my belly, creative power. It's a great job to learn to give rise to that force that emerges that wants to be a part, but that was silenced so many times that today it doesn't dare, it doesn't know when, it doesn't know how. It is a daily job to make room for it. To show her that there is room for her too. That she is perfect just the way she is and that no one is going to judge her, and I say it to her and I say it to myself when I say it to her. because she is me...she with all my other parts. I understand why they silenced her for so many years to protect me, not anymore. Today you can be free, you can be you, as you as you want and feel.

I have for the longes time, written little poems to give to people in greeting cards. They poems always were decent, but I would also have to devote time to creating them. I have have never been much of a drawer, I was just not able to create something from scratch in my mind. I do think my creativity manifests is a more technical way. Ever since I was little, I loved taking things apart, seeing how the parts fit together, how they were manufactured, what made them tick. So I naturally fell into engineering. Now I see my creativity as a tool to asses a design, figure out how it works, and what the problems are going to be down the line. This works well for my creatively style.

I feel as though I received only a jumbled mess of instructions in various dead languages and cave drawings. My brain is corrupted by demons that silence my ideas and creativity or something like that. It feels comparable to being pulled in several different directions at once. They create a silence, its inescapable. The feeling that it leaves me with is enough at times to literally prevent me from pursuing my ideas. I have given up on more things than most people attempt, or so I have been told. The brain makes its soup. The origin of your perception is where some would argue your soul resides.
