Which, although not my place of birth, it is certainly my home state per say..

He, much like his only son (*), likes to dig really deeply into the things he finds intriguing.

My father also believed in reincarnation, they both did. He was coming more from a budhist background, but he was equally as blind by a lot of his beliefs. Aside from believing in karma and reincarnation, they both believed they were special. I suppose many people do... I certainly felt that way growing up. Both of them had a level of pretension about them. Though I can and have been pretencious, I generally avoided that trait. But I did think i was special for a long time. Which is truly problematic for so many reasons. When you're involved with certain beliefs - particularly of new age - there's a tendency to feel your special. You think hey \"i'm different, I'm sensitive, so I am more elevated, evolved etc. That's what New age beliefs have you think. It actually creates a tonne of separation among people.

My father is extremely rational and during the time I was in the womb I imagine his creativity flowed around giving my mother certain gifts at the end of the day when she came home from work... or perhaps in his way of relating. in his free time with my mother and the experience he was having. But in broad strokes. I know that my father has always found it difficult to be and develop in creative spaces. For what he said. He is extremely rational and everything revolves around numbers. I imagine that my mother in her intimate spaces with her and I found creative spaces in our communication. She is very reserved and she keeps (almost) everything to herself. And I imagine that by being alone with another being inside her womb she may have felt safer and freer to talk to me and express herself... also giving freedom to her creativity because that space was new for her too. Creating something new. Well, all the physical, hormonal, emotional processes... pure divine creativity. Creating a being within it, I believe, is the most beautiful and pure form of creativity. The universe creating and re-creating itself through itself. And I'm not sure exactly in those exact times, but around those times, he developed creatively with the way of dressing... taking a lot of inspiration from the fashions that were, pardon the redundancy, fashionable... and expressing his individuality and essence through that too. In fact, I just remembered... that this process led her to sell maternity clothes. She had forgotten me. Of course... in this process, he was able to understand how difficult it was to find clothes for pregnant women. And I use this as a tool", "everything is transmitted, transgresses... my mother's emotions were mine throughout the entire process. My mother is one of the most creative people with the greatest sense of taste. At that time she made watercolor paintings, made Christmas and baptism cards. Beautiful, subtle, careful, safe and delicate lines. As children, she had a duck, made of seeds, that she spent hours looking at. She contemplated the wonder of the position of each seed. Each one perfectly placed so that the other fits in and as if each seed knew its place and existed to make a perfect whole. The duck itself was quite aesthetically ugly but its entire composition was wonderful to me. I remember the time when, with total innocence, I asked my mother where they had brought it from and she, with some embarrassment, answered that she had done it. There I understood and I believe that that attraction I felt for that duck, I don't know if he did it or not while I was in her womb, but I'm sure that something of that was transmitted to me. The love and attraction for the simple, and that because it is simple it becomes wonderful, grandiose, splendid. She always made drawings, collages, paintings, many crafts... Plus she has the most angelic voice I have ever heard. I dare say that the first time I got excited was listening to her sing... I imagine that she sang when she was pregnant, she sang to my brothers and I listened to her... the lullabies before going to sleep, pure sweetness. With my dad, on the other hand, there is not so much creativity as the ability to be in the present, we had adventures with him during pregnancy. He is the one who motivated us to take walks and outings through nature, walk, contemplate the sky, the grass, the trees, discover animals... I understand that by having very young siblings while I was still in my belly, I learned and listened to many things that They were teaching them, they were entering me too. What a nice memories. The art, the creative, the sensitive... they don't usually say or have many words of encouragement but they are always encouraging.", "I have always had the perception that my parents are not \"creative.\" My dad worked all his life in banks, following everything that is established within the routine of the life of \"normal\" people, who have a 9 to 5 job, and who have to follow the rules of an organization. . In my mind there is always the perception that these environments are not conducive to developing creatively, since they limit the capacity for experimentation and exploration, and lead people to simply \"do what they have to do\", which is ultimately something different from character. exploratory that creativity has.\n\nso, on my dad's side, I don't feel there has been an expression (or pursuit) of this creativity. I don't see him being creative. simply doing what he had to do to accomplish what he was asked to do. So no explicit expression of my dad's connection with creativity comes to me. It is a window that was quite closed, and that was not explored. following orders. following what is established.\n\nOn my mother's side, I see her as a person who, although it is true I have seen her explore these things in her life, it is always from \"following established patterns.\" When she went to painting classes, she was always copying a painting (or photo) that someone else had done. When she knits her socks, she is always making one sock very similar to another. or a vest modeled after someone else made. never going outside the \"pre-established\" schemes, or how \"it should be done\". I see in that a limitation, and an inability to explore what opening up to the exploration associated with the play that creativity brings, at least in my experience. I see creativity as a search for self-knowledge, and for that to happen, limits and schemes have to be broken in some way.\n\nIt is in this way that I have the feeling that there was no conscious and intentional vehicle to connect with creativity at the time I was inside my mother. I can't imagine that space. neither individually nor collectively. and that is something that has an impact on me, because I always think that there is a window of creativity that is quite closed. there is that Don `t close me. as if there were a key that is closed, and that is difficult to open. that I don't know how to explore. There's something in me that I sense could be changed and explored in a certain way, and that's what I'm doing now. exploring. with a renewed search for this creative capacity. with a search that leads me to want to develop in another way. with another energy, and search within me for creativity that was never encouraged.\n\nThey never helped me express myself creatively.\n\nI was never invited to explore the limits.\n\nand that makes me want to do it now without limits, and that search is more and more in me.", "When I was in my mother's womb, my father worked in the army, he was a soldier and a subordinate and he did that all his life, until he discharged.\nMy father took a course in the army which is the commando course, a course that is not for everyone and that is very difficult because it requires a lot of physical and mental resistance, exposure to hostile environments and difficult situations, handling of weapons, and being in the field. in war situations, etc.\nSo I feel that at that time my father had more freedom to carry out his creativity, since this course was also about surviving and for this you must improvise and look for ways and tools to do it.\nWhen my mother was carrying me, he worked in an office, so I don't know how much space he had to be creative and to be able to feel the freedom to propose his thoughts or ideas. In reality, that was how it was at that time, in general everyone worked in an office, with an established schedule and salary, receiving orders from a superior.\nBut my dad was always super connected to sports, he always liked to go jogging in the morning, he also really liked motorcycles and cars to go to the dunes and ride.\nI remember several motorcycles in the countryside and going out to ride a motorcycle in the pines, which was a very cool place in my grandparents' field and I also remember one time being in a red jeep jeeping in the dune, yes but I don't I liked it a lot, I remember it scared me,\nSo I feel like my dad was more connected to that\n\nAnd my mom was always a freer and more spontaneous soul, good at selling and doing business. My mother loved clothes and she has always liked fashion, shoes, and many times before she started in that field. She bought and sold clothes to her friends and she liked them a lot. At one time she had a store in a mall that was a sock store, and currently she has a very pretty dress store on the beach.\nI feel that my mother was more connected to creativity in terms of how creative one must be when being a mother and especially when being a mother of 6 children... amternity forces us in some way to connect with creativity since make food, even what to dress the children with and what to play with them.\nI remember an image of a situation in the apartment where we lived, in which we were in my room full of toys, playing and singing with my mother, listening to cachueros and singing with the microphone, I remember the messy piesa but everyone happy sharing the experience.", "Creativity for my Mum would have come in the form for cooking and baking.  \n\nMy father was creative within nature and also very hands on with DIY (do it yourself) task around a home that my parents were renovating.  \n\nThe impact that this has had on me is that I have a eye for aesthetics, I can arrange things that go well together.  \n\nI also enjoy been hands on, using my hands to create, creating a beautiful massage dance with my hands, my hands enjoy being physical and getting stuck into things.", "my parents were hippies, they lived in a commune, smoked weed and took other drugs.  guess the overall atmosphere was creative, fun and outgoing, gregarious even. Putting flowers in your hair as a decoration etc.\n\nI don't know who my biological father was, but according to my biological mother, he was a very smart person, who played against chess computers, back in the 1970s. He even travelled to Russia for this pursiot, which at the time was behind the iron Curtain in the cold war. \n\nMy mother liked watching birds, in the moment, not like a bird watcher, but let's say she had planned to go shopping, and she saw a bird in the garden, she would spend the next 30 minutes marvelling at this bird, and then realize the shop is close.\n\nI think that this in-the-moment being and doing gave space for expansive thinking. I don't know what impact this had on my creativity, but what I do know is that my birth was quite dramatic: I had to be taken out via a Cesarian cut across her belly, because I started to strangle myself with the umbilical cord, and back in the 70s a Cesarian still came with a certain risk for both the mother and the baby. I do notice an ever increasing impatience when things don't go to plan, and ultimately I can't stand it anymore and have to do sth. be proactive. \n\nI know that I can perform very well under pressure and often I am the most creative when time is running out. I think this might be related to my emergency cesarian.\n\nThe other thing that I know about myself is that when I smoked weed age 20 I also became very expressive and creative in a way that I couldn't access before. I studied classical philosophy, political theory and media analysis for a year, which sparked a cambrian explosion of intellectual thoughts, inquiry and also creative ideas in me.\n\nI am not a classic artist, think this is down to my mother who adopted me who forced me to re-learn writing with my right hand. But I am very creative in a macro wa", "During the entire period of", "This is a difficult construct to play on, as my parents were in a unique place, they got married mostly due to the fact that if they did'n't my great-grand mother would never allow me to be a part of the family \"properly\" as she was raised in the \"old Roman Catholic\" but I guess specifically, whatever parts branched over to North Dakota. Which, although not my place of birth, it is certainly my home state per say.. That being said, my mom was the creative, who likely spent most of her time writing when she was bedridden for the tail end of her pregnancy with me. What with that being the case, I know that she has boxes of writings from between 1998 and 1987, but to be honest, I am not sure I would ever ask about them. I know that her life has had traumas that I could not comprehend, therefore, I do not wish to know them. That being said, my dad is another type of creature... hard to describe for sure. He, much like his only son (*), likes to dig really deeply into the things he finds intriguing. Which can vary from time and place, however they mostly shape into interesting looking cars and trucks, basically, he was a \"motorhead\" who loved to listen to music and do drugs and have fun and then my mom got knocked up and he decided to finish college. So they ran off to Vermont together and got married while there... long story short They didn't live happily ever after, lol but to say the least they did their best. That being said, his art would b", "my Mom was in a cult. Church Universal and Triumphant. There were a lot of fucked up beliefs that were indoctrinated by the leader Elizabeth Clare Prophet. I'm not sure precisely all the things my mother believed or believes, but at the time a lot of the do's and don't and ideas on karma etc certainly affected the way my Mom thought about life. My father also believed in reincarnation, they both did. He was coming more from a budhist background, but he was equally as blind by a lot of his beliefs. Aside from believing in karma and reincarnation, they both believed they were special. I suppose many people do... I certainly felt that way growing up. Both of them had a level of pretension about them. Though I can and have been pretencious, I generally avoided that trait. But I did think i was special for a long time. Which is truly problematic for so many reasons. When you're involved with certain beliefs - particularly of new age - there's a tendency to feel your special. You think hey \"i'm different, I'm sensitive, so I am more elevated, evolved etc. That's what New age beliefs have you think. It actually creates a tonne of separation among people. The idea that some people are evolved and some are not. At the end of the day, the way we evolve is our choice from the moment we are adults!", "I have always felt that I am very lucky to have been fathered by two artists. They were always surrounded by art in their lives, since everything they built for their lives and work required them in some way to keep their creativity active.\nPerhaps one of the greatest lessons regarding this topic was that there is nothing that is wrong, there is no stereotype or image to follow in order to express what is inside us, since if we allow it to be expressed, we will know our own art and path of self-discovery.\nIt is true that this expression of creativity was already in my life even in my mother's womb. I remember that her painting workshop, when I was a child, made me feel like I was in a womb. It was a hidden space, outside the house... the backyard was paved with stones, and there were some plants that surrounded the entire door to the workshop.\nThere was a window in the ceiling that let beautiful light into the space, making you feel like you were in some kind of hidden burrow.\nThere were many paintings, pictures, drawings, cushions and it was a very pleasant and beautiful space. At the exit there was a small pool-shaped pool. Surrounded by this stone floor, and plants in a small backyard of the house.\nIt was a small space in total, but there was a feeling of expansion within it, like a portal to a magical dimension of the world. The light of midday and afternoon came in, giving nuances and different faces to the same mutable space.\nThis space was probably built while I was still living in my mother's womb, and since my father was an architect, they both actively participated in the construction, transformation and adaptation to this space. Giving my mother a place of her own, I am sure that all of this influences my creative expression, and idealization of the magic embodied in the earth.", "I don\u2019t think I have ever considered my parents creative. I cannot think of a single time where we as a family or they as individuals created anything. It always seemed that they expressed themselves through action rather than cocreating something. While I don\u2019t recall them being creative I. The artistic sense, my dad was creative in using what was available to make something work. I think I am definitely in the later camp. I would not consider myself creative in the arts, at least not naturally. But I am very good at seeing how thing fit together and influence each other. I\u2019m also able to envision what will make the system not work properly. Which has benefited me greatly in my career. It is interesting though that if I devote specific thought towards the action I am able to create in many medium. As example I was part of an improve group in high school and I have always made up poems when I\u2019m giving a card to someone. So I consider my creativity to be more attributed to my ability to dissect a specific topic and determine why I think it works and then modify some part of the process or go a completely different direction but as long as I have a framework to develop an understanding, I can be creative when the time calls for it. I don\u2019t know that I can think of a specific creative aspect of mu m"]}
