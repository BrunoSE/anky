I had a funny feeling, but I didn't pay too much attention to it. The results came back clear and I continued on with life as usual. One night, after a really intense break up, I had a very precise dream. There was a pigeon that was flying toward me and as it got close, it turned into a dove. It pecked me with its beak right on my throat, followed by one perfect droplet of  blood. At the time I was really into everything New Age. When I woke I immediately went to the book to look up the throat chakra. Turned out, the throat and the sacral chakra were interconnected. The content warned that imbalances could cause cancer.  I immediately called my doctor and requestted she redo the pap smear.

Ella me conto que su embarazo fue bueno, pero que tenia una dificil relacion con mi papa. Ella me conto que el no la trataba muy bien desde el ambito emocional, no la trataba con cari\u00f1o, pero que siempre se preocupo de que ella estuviera bien y tuviera lo que necesitaba para estar tranquila.\nCreo que todo esto insegurizo mucho a mi mama y eso siento que se manfiesta en mi de alguna manera, y evidentemente en mi hija.

So I guess my dad had plans to go hunting and he was working as a painter at the time, so he worked a lot anyway. It happened to be right around Christmas when my mom found out about me. So while he was in the preparation stage of his hunting trip, my mom surprised him with the news. From what I'm told he said something along the lines of the holidays being ruined. He later came to his senses and realized what he said and made it up to her, and was a good dad to me as well. It is funny how we react to life changing news in the moment. It is almost like when they say you are the most honest when you're drunk. I'm not sure I buy that, because people do some crazy things when they are in shock. I think that story is pretty indicative of how my family communicates. We may say some things that sound mean, but it is usually just a knee jerk reaction. We eventually realize that we were being selfish and make it right. The important thing was to be there for each other.

I have been assured that I was a planned conception, and that may be; it matters not to me. She was working as far as I am aware. She has told me stories of showing me off to co-workers at the bank. I believe she was a bank teller and manager. My father would have been her support system. She was 34 when she had me, so she was 33 while I was carried. I think she must have felt like she was in love since she was so trusting with my father. She lost her mother either the year I was born or the year before, and that was very traumatic for her.

My mother was not working and hasn't really ever had a job since she has been with my dad, which makes me think she was kind of relaxed or not demanded regarding work. But, there is one thing I  do remember her saying a lot, and that is that she was fed up and annoyed of having workers at home. At that time my house was being sort of in remodelation or some sort of construction. Probably preparing for the new family member. And in this moment, due to this, my mother decided to move for the time and rent an apartment on the beach where she felt much more relaxes. Maybe im making this up kind of how i would like it to be, because that would explain a lot my connection with water and the ocean. Maybe I felt how she became more relax by breathing the ocean breeze and not having the workers around anymore, and this feeling of release and liberation was passed on to me. She must of had been around 40 years old or a bit after 35 when she was pregnant of me. I know my father, my sister and brother were around her but I also know we had a nanny that helped and probably her friends.

My mom was, admittedly, not ready for parenthood and she says she doesn't regret having me, but I used to have my doubts (probably just negative self talk influencing my perspective).

When I was growing up I heard the Beatles and grew to like them. In hard times, some of their songs remind me of home, not as a place, but as a state of remembering something that was safe and cozy. I guess I was brainwashed in a good way. When I grew up, I met people who claimed that the Beatles are not that great. i recognize their opinion as something that is valid for them, but people sometimes forget to express their knowing that what they say is just their opinion, or maybe they don't remember. maybe they don't know. maybe people think that what they think is real. i'm not talking about correct or incorrect, good or bad, but rather ..... something like making eggs. omelette has a recipe, but omelette doesn't exhist. it's just an experience. it exists as an experience of someone lucky enough to have food on the table.\nso here we are back in time, in my mother's belly. i listen to the Beatles and somehow like it. the communication of my parents was probably very innocent and good, because they were young parents. they are still young on the inside, but are geting a little bit older. we just saw a play where Merry and Pippin, the most distinguished hobbits played Rozenkrantz and Gildenstern and they did a great job. i remember them being in the Lord of the Rings, now they are in their late 40s and 50s. interesting to observe myself and finally getting the plot of that story. the meaning. the depth. i don't need to get lost even if i have no direction. if others didn't tell me where to go it is ok to keep walking through the dark. it is highly important not to damage oneself, because this thing doesn't really end. it does but it does not. it is a part of something.

She moved with purpose, her artist's eye carefully selecting the ripest tomatoes and the most vibrant bunches of kale. The sun's warmth embraced her, and she paused for a moment, savoring the simple joy of being surrounded by the earth's bounty.\n\nAs she made her way home, Luna's thoughts wandered to the challenges that lay ahead. Balancing her work at the community center with the demands of preparing for her baby's arrival seemed daunting at times. She entered her small, cozy apartment, setting her market finds on the kitchen counter. With a deep breath, she rolled up her sleeves and began to wash and chop the vegetables, finding solace in the simple, repetitive task.\n\nLuna's mind drifted to the stories she had heard from other mothers in her life - tales of resilience and strength in the face of adversity. She thought of her own mother, who had raised her and her siblings alone, working tirelessly to provide for them. Luna drew inspiration from these women, knowing that she, too, possessed the inner fortitude to navigate the challenges of motherhood.\n\nAs she prepared a nourishing meal, Luna reflected on her journey thus far. The decision to embrace this new chapter in her life had not been an easy one. When she first discovered her pregnancy, a myriad of emotions had coursed through her - fear, uncertainty, but also a profound sense of awe and responsibility. She had always been a free spirit, her art and community work taking center stage in her life. The idea of motherhood had seemed distant, a role she had not actively sought out.\n\nYet, as the reality of the tiny life growing within her took hold, Luna found herself embracing the change with a newfound sense of purpose. She knew that this child, conceived under the stars amidst the pulsing energy of the festival, was meant to be a part of her story. The universe had conspired to bring this soul into her life, and she was determined to rise to the occasion.\n\nLuna's hand instinctively went to her belly, feeling the gentle flutters of movement within. A smile played on her lips as she imagined the little being taking shape, a perfect blend of herself and the man whose passion had ignited her own that fateful night. Though their connection had been fleeting, Luna held no resentment or longing for what could have been. She knew that this child was hers to nurture and guide, and she would pour all her love into being the best mother she could be.\n\nAs the days grew shorter and the leaves began to turn, Luna found herself grappling with the changes that came with her move to a new city. The unfamiliar streets and foreign languages that surrounded her felt isolating at times. She longed for the comfort of her hometown and the support of her family and friends.\n\nOne crisp autumn morning, Luna stumbled upon a flyer for a community gathering in the park near her apartment. Intrigued, she decided to attend, hoping to forge new connections in this strange place. As she arrived at the park, she was greeted by the warm smiles of her neighbors, their faces reflecting the diversity of the city.\n\nLuna found herself drawn into conversations with other expectant mothers, their shared experiences bridging the gaps of language and culture. They exchanged stories of their hopes and fears, their laughter mingling with the rustling of the fallen leaves. In that moment, Luna realized that she was not alone in her journey - that there was strength to be found in the bonds of community.\n\nAs her pregnancy progressed, Luna found solace in the support of her newfound friends. They gathered for prenatal yoga classes in the park, their bodies moving in unison as they celebrated the miraculous changes taking place within them. They shared meals, each dish a reflection of their diverse cultural backgrounds, nourishing both body and soul.\n\nOn a particularly challenging day, Luna found herself at her wit's end, overwhelmed by the weight of impending motherhood. She reached out to her neighbor, Maria, who had become a close confidant. Maria arrived at Luna's door with a warm embrace and a listening ear. As they sat together, sipping tea and sharing stories, Luna felt the knots of anxiety begin to unravel.\n\nMaria shared her own experiences of motherhood, offering words of wisdom and encouragement. She reminded Luna of the incredible strength that lies within every mother - the ability to nurture and protect, to love and guide. Luna felt a renewed sense of purpose, a deep knowing that she was capable of being the mother her child needed.\n\nAs the final weeks of her pregnancy approached, Luna found herself drawn to the quiet solitude of the nearby woods. She walked among the towering trees, their leaves a riot of autumn colors, and felt a deep connection to the earth beneath her feet. In these moments of reflection, she contemplated the journey that lay ahead - the joys and challenges, the love and sacrifice.\n\nLuna knew that her life was about to change in ways she could never fully imagine. But she also knew that she was ready to embrace this new chapter, to pour her heart and soul into nurturing the tiny life growing within her. She placed a hand on her belly, feeling the gentle kicks of her unborn child, and smiled.\n\nIn that moment, Luna made a silent promise to her baby - a promise to love fiercely, to guide with wisdom, and to always be a source of strength and support. She knew that the road ahead would not be easy, but she also knew that she possessed the resilience and grace to navigate whatever lay ahead.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting a golden glow across the forest floor, Luna turned back towards home, her heart full of hope and anticipation for the future that awaited her and her child. She carried with her the stories of the mothers who had come before her, their strength and love woven into the very fabric of her being. With each step, she felt the power of their collective wisdom guiding her forward, a reminder that she was never truly alone on this transformative journey.\n\nLuna's story was just beginning, a tapestry of love, resilience, and growth that would shape not only her own life but also the life of the little soul she carried within her. As she stepped into the warmth of her apartment, she knew that whatever challenges lay ahead, she would face them with the same unwavering spirit that had brought her to this moment. For now, she would cherish each day, nurturing the precious gift of life that had been entrusted to her, and eagerly awaiting the moment when she would hold her child in her arms for the first time.", "summaryOfChapter": "In Chapter 3, Luna's journey of anticipation and introspection deepens as she navigates the physical and emotional landscapes of impending motherhood. The narrative follows her through the vibrant life of a farmers' market, symbolizing her connection to the earth and the cycles of life, and back to her personal sanctuary where she contemplates the responsibilities and joys of becoming a mother. Her interaction with the environment and her reflections reveal a woman deeply rooted in the natural world and in tune with the life force pulsating within her.\n\nLuna's musings about her own mother and the other maternal figures in her life underscore her awareness of the lineage of strength and resilience she is part of, shaping her anticipation and approach to motherhood. Her internal dialogue reveals a woman who, while facing the uncertainties of this new chapter, draws strength from the collective wisdom and experiences of the women before her, readying herself to embrace the role of a mother with grace and courage.\n\nThe narrative also explores Luna's feelings of isolation in a new city and her proactive steps towards building a supportive community, highlighting the importance of connection and shared experiences in her journey. Her interactions at the community gathering and the prenatal yoga sessions are poignant reminders of the collective journey of motherhood, the shared hopes, fears, and joys that bind strangers together into a supportive network.\n\nThe chapter concludes with Luna in a moment of solitary reflection in the woods, symbolizing her deep connection with nature and her introspective nature. This scene encapsulates her transformation from an individual to a mother-to-be, poised on the brink of a life-altering new role, yet grounded in the strength and wisdom passed down through generations of women. Her silent promise to her unborn child is a testament to her readiness and resolve to provide a nurturing, loving, and guiding presence in her child\u2019s life.\n\nThrough Luna\u2019s story in this chapter, the narrative weaves themes of growth, preparation, and the natural cycle of life, illustrating the transformative journey of motherhood as one of both individual and collective evolution.", "userFeedbackForChapter": "[\"This is the first chapter that has seem to have a consistent story.

So I guess my dad had plans to go hunting and he was working as a painter at the time, so he worked a lot anyway. It happened to be right around Christmas when my mom found out about me. So while he was in the preparation stage of his hunting trip, my mom surprised him with the news. From what I'm told he said something along the lines of the holidays being ruined. He later came to his senses and realized what he said and made it up to her, and was a good dad to me as well. It is funny how we react to life changing news in the moment. It is almost like when they say you are the most honest when you're drunk. I'm not sure I buy that, because people do some crazy things when they are in shock.

She lived in the German Democratic Republic in the 80s. She had been home with my father for 2 years.\nBoth Chileans, she went on scholarship, my father was exiled. My mother worked in a huge Library located in the center of Potsdam. This city is beautiful, bathed by a river and full of green parks, swans and ducks. Architecturally beautiful.\nMy mother had me when she was 40 years old. She told me that she believed she was not going to get pregnant, so it was a surprise when she found out about my arrival. I am excited about this moment since it is the first time I have written about her, since a little less than two years ago she left for another place to rest. My mother's childhood was not easy, rather very difficult. I know she was", "Shola the truth is that I have. What to translate to be able to understand the text, my mother\u2026\u2026.. the whole process of carrying me in her womb was quite hard since I did not have much support from my father and she was able to move forward with my brother and I inside her\u2026.it was always very attached to her children and parents more than to my dad, since he was never present, she...she was approximately 35 years old when she had me noooo yes.

When I was growing up I heard the Beatles and grew to like them. In hard times, some of their songs remind me of home, not as a place, but as a state of remembering something that was safe and cozy. I guess I was brainwashed in a good way. When I grew up, I met people who claimed that the Beatles are not that great. i recognize their opinion as something that is valid for them, but people sometimes forget to express their knowing that what they say is just their opinion, or maybe they don't remember. maybe they don't know. maybe people think that what they think is real. i'm not talking about correct or incorrect, good or bad, but rather ..... something like making eggs. omelette has a recipe, but omelette doesn't exhist. it's just an experience. it exists as an experience of someone lucky enough to have food on the table.\nso here we are back in time, in my mother's belly. i listen to the Beatles and somehow like it. the communication of my parents was probably very innocent and good, because they were young parents. they are still young on the inside, but are geting a little bit older. we just saw a play where Merry and Pippin, the most distinguished hobbits played Rozenkrantz and Gildenstern and they did a great job. i remember them being in the Lord of the Rings, now they are in their late 40s and 50s. interesting to observe myself and finally getting the plot of that story. the meaning. the depth. i don't need to get lost even if i have no direction. if others didn't tell me where to go it is ok to keep walking through the dark. it is highly important not to damage oneself, because this thing doesn't really end. it does but it does not. it is a part of something."], "translated_userFeedbackForChapter": []}
