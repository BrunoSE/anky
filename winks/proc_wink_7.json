        "I don't really know how to respond to this. In my last submission, I mentioned being Mennonite, a group not entirely unlike the Amish. Through my childhood my sisters always wore plain dresses, then changed to shirts and skirts with pants since doing manual labor in a dress is a little annoying. The other things is veilings, my sisters wore them, and my mother still wears them. I've not felt overly connected to these things, other than a dislike of wearing graphic tees or shorts, I never felt constrained by my clothing choices. I know that my parents value work, and that we should help others. Many times I volunteered to help at foodbanks or family friends who were older and couldn't do so much physical labor. Many times as a child I remember going with my mother to pick up food and deliver it to people who had a hard time getting out of their house, we still do this, though now with my physical health so degraded I don't do much heavy lifting, since I really can't. I remember going to church every sunday, we are a religions people. We also went to many ",
        "My parents were vaguely religious, but the norm of the time was a conservative Christian coalition that carried much of the country in political battles. The Cold War was just coming to an end. Both my father and mother espoused Christianity to be their faith, but the were never fully steeped in the Church and its doctrines prior to us beginning to attend the Church that I would eventually go to school in. The need to question the doctrines of the Church was not something that ever particularly occurred to my parents I don't believe. It was left to me to discern what was valid and relevant in the Bible, and what was not. So I studied, and tried to understand the underlying precepts of morality, dogma, and religion. I don't think my mother had any deeper beliefs. She tends to shy away from concepts with deep philosophical meaning. Not that she can't mind you. She is extremely intelligent and perceptive, she just chooses not to engage in that sort of philosophical discussion. My father seemed to be far more religious and introspective, but he didn't seem to be any more knowledgeable. On the contrary, neither one of them knew their way around a Bible, or had even read the whole thing. It was always astonishing to me later how someone could supposedly center their life around a series of concepts, but have no personal familiarity with them. I found it to be tremendously intellectually inconsistent. I have never understood how they could send us to school to learn something that they themselves couldn't be bothered to learn despite the fact that their souls relied upon it.",
        "muy interesante pregunta de la cual de nuevo no tengo ni la más remota idea; mis papás se identifican a sí mismos, por así decirlo, como católicos, sin embargo no estoy muy de acuerdo con ello, por otro lado, en ese momento no sé que tan acercados estarían a la iglesia, si iban a misa y esas cosas; lo más probable es que sí, ya que mi mamá siempre ha sido más devota; y que mi papá estuviera yendo para acompañarla, él siempre ha sido más light incluso contradictorio con la -supuesta- fe que tiene. Por otro lado, no creo que hayan tenido conversaciones al respecto, tal vez mi mamá rezaba algunas oraciones de vez en cuando. Que sería en todo caso lo que yo podría estar escuchando. Hay algo muy interesante al respecto y es que eso que escuchamos en el vientre no viene de fuera, como otros sonidos, sino de adentro, por los huesos y tal, se transmiten las vibraciones y así es como escuchan los bebés, el día que cai en cuenta de eso me pareció algo muy \"mindblowing\"... ya que se estaría escuchando la voz muy distinta a cómo la escuchan los demás e incluso como la mujer embarazada se escucha a sí misma. \n\nEn este momento estoy pensando que estos prompts de seguro harían enojar a una persona  de las que dicen que los niños en el vientre no son personas... qué postura más extraña e incluso irracional me parece esa. Percibo una postura en estos prompts en los que se aprecia a la persona desde la concepción, y en estos días es algo muy difícil de encontrar. Es de las cosas de estos tiempos que me parecen más barbáricas.\n\nEsa linea naranja como tarda...XD ... y parece que aqui es donde empiezo a desvariar.. y creo que el prompt de ayer me lo perdí ni sé cuál fue. nimodo así pasa. uuuu hoy fui de compraas locaaas con mi hermana, compré muchas cooosaaas wuuuuu, uniformes, útiles escolares, juegos y unos rubik cubes para miiii yaaay!!! es muy divertido ir de compras con mi hermana la vdd... a ver si mañana vamos de nuevo pq les quiero comprar unas cosas a mis sobrinos, se acerca el día del niño acá. quiero comprarles cositas bonis =) espero encontrar  BBB...  y ya nos vemos mañana si se puede adioooos",
        "de qué forma éstos moldearon mi conexión con lo sutil?\n\ncuáles son éstos? a qué me refiero cuando hablo de éstos?\n\nmis papás en la época en la que yo era joven se relacionaban con la iglesia católica, y eso es lo que yo vi mientras crecía. tengo memorias de cuando chico ir a misa recurrentemente, y siempre mis papás hablaron de \"Dios\" (pero sin ser extremadamente religiosos en su quehacer y práctica espiritual).\n\nla conexión con esa energía espiritual, divina, generalmente venía desde afuera. desde una imposición, desde un quehacer que viene desde lo que el mundo espera que hagas, desde lo que el mundo espera que te relaciones. desde lo que el mundo espera que \"deberías hacer en cuando a la energía espiritual\". pero nada más allá de eso. no había -y nunca ha habido- una energía espiritual que subyaciera su quehacer. nunca fue más que \"hacer la parada\" de ir a misa, como un ritual que no tenía mucho sentido más allá del hecho mismo. no era un ritual que yo sintiera como algo trascendente, si no que bien, bien, bien anclado en el ego, y en la relación de éste ego con el resto, a partir de la práctica espiritual hecha y llevada a cabo para pertenecer. para ser parte de algo.\n\nfueron e iban a misa porque \"era lo que tenían que hacer\". esto me recuerda a cuando hice el curso de yoga, y veía muchas personas que estaban ahí porque \"querían ser profesores de yoga\". no porque querían explorar directa y sinceramente su relación con el espíritu, que es lo que yo considero una práctica espiritual consciente, y llevada a cabo con la intención directa de elevar la consciencia.\n\nla práctica espiritual de mis papás mientras yo estaba en el vientre nunca estuvo relacionada con la elevación de la conciencia, si no que con el anclaje de la conciencia con el ego. a través del ego.\n\ny desde ahí, eso toca mi esencia porque me ha llevado a estar conectado con este ego incluso desde la práctica espiritual. ha sido difícil para mi llevar a cabo una práctica espiritual que esté completamente ausente de una expectativa egoica. siempre está relacionada -en lo profundo de mi inconsciente- con lo que el resto va a pensar de mi, o más que eso, con una expectativa. siempre esta práctica espiritual está relacionada con la expectativa, y eso es lo que es importante avanzar hacia entender. hacia recibir. hacia abrazar.\n\nabrazamos la práctica espiritual, y a partir de ello, la integramos. no sé qué otra creencia universal tenían mis papás, la verdad. no me los imagino teniendo una práctica consciente. no me los imagino entregándole tiempo a la elevación de su espír",
        "El útero de mi madre estaba frío. Hacía apenas 6 meses había dado a luz a un hijo, mi hermano. Previo a esto, había tenido ya otro parto y anteriormente un aborto, aparentemente, espontáneo. Yo dudo de esto último, es un secreto familiar. Ese primer embarazo fue concebido fuera del matrimonio lo que para las familias de mi padre y de mi madre era inconcebible y completamente desaprobado. Así es que fui la cuarta en estar en ese útero. como decía, al principio estaba frío, ella tardó varios meses en darse cuenta que estaba esperando otro hijo. Cuando lo hizo sintió mucho miedo, la situación económica no era la óptima. Fue mi padre quien logró calmarla y transmitirle seguridad. Mas alla de los miedos y malestares que logro ver hoy en mi, que creo vinieron de esa primera experiencia, también hubo amor, cuidado, cariño y mucha alegría de ser la primera mujer, después de dos varones. Por más que yo reniegue hoy de eso, entiendo que para ellos fue alegría saber mi sexo. Además, ambos son personas religiosas, creyentes y hoy logro verlas muy espirituales, conectadas con su lado más sensible y con fe. Siempre creyeron que todo iba a ser de la mejor manera, que las cosas suceden y hay que afrontarlas y hacer algo para que eso sea del mejor modo posible. Quizas mi madre se sintió bastante sola durante su embarazo, ella no es de la ciudad en la que vivía, esa era la ciudad de la familia de mi papá. Muchas, por no decir todas, de las tareas domesticas recayeron sobre ella, dos niños muy pequeños, un embarazo en curso, sin trabajo, me imagino que no era el mejor panorama. Sin embargo, todo esto es lo que puedo llegar a ver yo, porque cuando les pregunto a ellos no son muchos los recuerdos que tienen. Los habran bloqueado? Hay algo en el organismo que es sabio y nos hace olvidar momentos que han si",
        "Yo creo que con respecto a la atmósfera espiritual según mi entendimiento mientras estaba en el útero ,puede que sea algo abstracto sin tener un conocimiento amplio de la palabra mi universo en ese instante o mi mundo cuando estaba dentro del útero era limitado, pensando que solo existía eso, es como cuando una gusano evoluciona a mariposa, siente miedo de lo desconocido mientras no sabe que terminara seno siendo mariposa, sea extraño pensar en que pensaban mis padres en ese momento, pero creo q ellos no tenían tampoco ese entendimiento, menos yo la verdad, se que existe algo que esta fuera de nuestros sentidos y que al final desconozco tanto sobre el tema que me es difícil explicar alg solido, obviamente esta atmósfera espiritual influyo en ellos de alguna manera, pero saber exactamente en que influenció es super f.   Complejo de definir, creo que la existencia en si es perfecta, todo pasa por algo, ese plan universal obviamente hizo que la vida y mi experiencia junto a la de mis padres, fuera de esa forma , pero a la ves es un plan que desconocemos, todo llevo a lo que hoy en día esta sucediendo, ahora el hecho de estar escribiendo aquí, es parte de ese proceso, de las conooooooo.   Conexiones que tenemos con nuestros pares, e hecho de que todo esta planeado o mas bien todo es perfecto buscando el balance entre lo bueno y lo malo, somos energía, positiva y negativa, y eso se debe equilibrar de cierta forma,,,, pensando en la pregunta que es muy profunda , debo decir que la está influencia que provoco la atmósfera espiritual, simplemente es desconocida para mi, solo lo acepto…….. pensando que todo pasa por algo  por esta razón creo que es bueno solo aceptar y dejar de luchar contra lo que no entiendo y desconozco c",
        "mis padres católicos, cristianos practicantes. Ellos mismo criados en esas creencias y valores. El útero de mi madre estaba frío, hacía tan solo 6 meses había parido a un hijo, mi hermano. Al momento de quedar ella embarazada aun estaba amamantandolo. Su energía estaba toda abocada a la crianza de este nuevo hijo y de su hermano mayor. Es decir, que varios meses tardó en registrar que nueva vida estaba gestando, así es el puerperio a veces. El registro que ella tenia de su cuerpo era practicamente nulo. El día que se entera de mi embarazo lo vive con angustia y miedo. Miedo de no poder darle a los niños lo que necesitan. Es mi padre quien logra calmarla y transmitirle seguridad. Hoy en día para ellos estos momentos son momentos que dicen recordar felices. Sin embargo, yendo más profundo uno puede ver en su mirada y en sus gestos rastros del miedo. Un miedo que yo tambien siento , principalmente al momento de arrancar cosas nuevas. Generalmente es frio, sera este miedo el miedo de los primeros meses en el utero cuando nadie sabia/registraa/era consciente que estaba ahi?\nYo creo que si.\nese miedo es mio, pero en realidad es el miedo de mi madre y es un miedo transgeneracional, porque tambien es el miedo de su madre. \nMas alla de eso, por mas que yo renegue muchos años del hecho de la religion, creo que sus creencias, su fe, y  sobretodo la espiritualidad es algo que desde la gestación se me tranmitió. Hoy a mi manera, de un modo muy diferente al de ellos, el cual trajo no pocos problemas y desencuentros, tengo una gran espiritualidad. Un gran sentido y gusto por los misterios de la vida. Como así tambien esta sensación que tuve desde, creeria tambien desde el utero, de no pertenecer. No ser bienvenida, no tener que molestar. Pasar desapercibida. Arreglarmela sola, sin ayuda. Como nadie me esperó. ",
        "Mi mamá viene de una familia más católicas, mi papá no tanto. Mi mamá os llevó a misa cuando chicos, nos hizo hacer la primera comunión, la confirmación, etc. Ella nos mostró ese mundo, nosotros decidimos que no pertenecíamos a él. Si mi papá hubiese ido a misa talvez no nos hubiésemos planteado otra cosa. Creo que influyó que tuviéramos dos  frentes distintos donde mirar, y eso creo, es muy enriquecedor. Puede haber una mezcla entre creer en algo y no creer en nada, dos extremos con muchos matices entremedio. Mi papá es más científico para sus creencias, ver para creer, pruebas y esas cosas. No quita que una vez tuvo una experiencia de desdoblamiento, comienzo de un viaje astral, y seguro lo habrá dejado con preguntas....pero creo que en eso quedó y no se lo planteó más. Creo que los dos son bastante terrenales y no creo que crean en la multidimensionalidad del ser , como yo. Lo digo porque alguna vez les he hablado de eso y no enganchan en la conversación. La parte espiritual no los mueve mucho en ese sentido. Pero no importa. Yo  creo que igual moldearon mi conexión con el mundo regalándome esos dos extremos entre la iglesia católica y lo súper científico. Yo elegí todos los matices entre medio. No estoy muy segura como contestar esta pregunta porque la verdad es que no lo sé muy bien. El ambiente espiritual y existencial durante mi tiempo en el vientre....a misa fui seguro! Mi papá no estaba, o no estuvo por lo menos los últimos meses de mi embarazo...así es que no sé muy bien esa parte. Existencial espiritual..",
        "So, in my experience, or what I can remember of it. I could say that it was like being constantly guided like, in the way an umbrella guides your body through a rainstorm in order for you to stay (as much as you can) dry... That being said. My dad was a \"devout\" catholic most of his life. I would say that he still is today, but he would I guess technically fall closer (LOL) under the umbrella of a Lutheran in the sense that, in the eyes of a \"Roman Catholic\" like my dad wars raised to be, he would be considered lazy, in that he rarely goes to church, etc... Anyway, my mom on the other hand was for all intents and purposes, \"a black sheep\" so she was not a religious person, to say the least. With that being said, their love was above all, for me unbreakable at that point. All things considered, I am not sure they loved much else. The funny thing is, even today, if I were to mention my dad and say how he is \"doing well and feeling great\" or whatever, the look  in my moms eyes is just.... hard to explain. Like a sense of lost desire? Idk. The point is, my world views are very much that of a techno-hippie that has really just no clue what's going on at times, but really does their best. And to be honest, I am a little bit biased in my experiences, both in person, on the telephone, in web3, on the internet in general, I would say, people could stand to learn something from what I have experienced, from what I have seen and done and what has happened to me. The bottom line is though, I think that is true for everybody. Which, I also think clearly aligns me with what my parents would have hoped for me to be. The person I am is an accurate reflection of the compo",
        "el ambiente espiritual que habia durante mi gestacion no lo tengo claro, solo se que mis padres eran bastante religiosos, osea no religiosos como que fueran personas activas en la iglesia ni nada por el estilo.

Muy chicos pero antiguamente era normal que las mujeres se casaran tan jovenes y que comenzaran a tener hijos jovenes.\nHoy dia fuimos a un cumpleaños donde la mayoria de los invitados tenian hijos, algunos mas grandes o algunos mas pequeños que la mila y senti mucha nostalgia de no tener un grupo de amigos asi aqui, afiatados a los que invitar a un asado y que fueran con sus hijos para que compartieran con la mila.\nA veces esas cosas extraño de santiago y de tener mas amigos y amigas alla, ose igual siento que tengo pocos y pocas amigas con las que interactuo a diario.

        "It is interesting to think of my parents beliefs. I never considered them religious people so their beliefs, at least as I interpret them are related to the way you love your life more than a set religious system. I definitely viewed my dad as a strait laced hard working type. As o got older and realized that a lot of his advise had been used to get myself out of trouble, I’ve started to wonder if he live a more nefarious life than I or many expected. He made sure to drive a work ethic into my brother and I which while I am thankful for as an adult, I am still not sure if it is worth the cost to the relationship with them as a child. I would not change my upbringing but I am also not sure that I am going to be able to instill the same drive and determination in my children, if I’m not willing to be the asshole it take to teach the lesson. My mom is a bit more of an enigma. I can’t specifically pinpoint an attribute that I have to her bother than my ability to jive with many different types of people. My mom always seemed like a go with the flow type of person, which is very much who I am, but it makes it hard to say that they specifically influenced you when they’re primary influence was what ever was needed at the time. It make my mom seem like ",
        "Both my parents were quite \"spiritual\". My father however didn't want me, and I think I felt that in the whomb. My mother was extremely stressed all the time, and like many other people that are suffering, turned to \"new age\" beliefs. Which were really just a mash up of exisiting beliefs from various religions, saints, \"masters\", gurus, and fake teachers. The new age community is full of these fakes, but I was gullable as a kid, and carried a lot of these beliefs with me. As I got older, specifically in my later teenage years, I became quite intrigued with spirituality. I pretty much believed every single non sensicle thing out there. And I wasn't alone. In fact it was the norm in the communities I was a part of to believe the most insane, non- factual things because we were all suffering so much, we just wanted some semblance of peace, and of hope for a better life, or a better version of ourselves, usually both. This suffering is something every single person knows and craves to not have. But suffering is a part of life. Of course we have choice, to make things better for us or worse, but the circumstances we're born into , the countries, cultures, families and societies deeply impact the way we think- or the way we don't. And that was my biggest discvery 10 years ago= we dont knwo how to thinkf for ourseleves! THINK FOR YOURSELF!\n",
        "Good question. My assumption of what my parent's beliefs were include thinking of the future as a good place. my dad already might have thought that it would be a good idea to leave russia - a place that doesn't work on logic. it is interesting to note that years later, Canada does not work on logic either. maybe its just the human condition. even the greener pastures are not as green as they seem. my grandmother was very spiritual. she recited the Jesus Prayer in her mind. a practice held by the Old Believers, who were forced to hide their practices. maybe it was for the good. one must hide their spiritual work in order to continue doing it. maybe this is a human condition too. when we talk about our inner and outer achievements we may fall prey to egotism and narcissism. those things just catch us in their cradle and slowly shake us to sleep. and we dream that we are doing what needs to be done, but somehow we are not even close. another assumption perhaps by i do see it at least a little bit. life is a beautiful gift we have whichever the situation is. we can do so many things. we can create so much. but maybe only in scarcity. when we are out of water or free time, we start to think what to do. but of course if we are out of something, we may also drop into blindness and carry on until we die. human condition? some people strive to understand, even if it takes everything we got. but they keep going. composing a whole opera, finishing a play. maybe i should finish the book of short stories. something that is meaningful, so i can show how i see the world to others. life is a beautiful gift. don't go to quick, life, just go quick enough. do your thing, but don't run too fast. keep the heartbeat going. go with the tempo of the heart. life is good. love is good too. maybe that is the value that my parents had, keeping love inside the heart",
        "Creo que las atmosferas que se remonten a ese momento de mi existencia, tenian colores rojizos, amarillos, verdes… como una lampara de lava que se mueve lenta e hipnotizantemente. Esto podria representar un contexto espiritual ya que la forma que toma el mundo en realidad es reflejo de nuestro interior. Y esta realidad interior proyectada en el exterior, por su puesto todavia no tenia cuerpo, por ende, no habia una materia capaz de percibir y almacenar en memoria formas y aspectos de la vida a traves de un cuerpo humano. Quizas mis padres ya habian complejizado esta matriz de colores, en las formas que hoy la sociedad se ha puesto de acuerdo para describir la realidad, pero son solo acuerdos. No es gran cosa reconstruirlo a nuestro antojo, la gran cosa es ser capaces de vivir experiencias individuales que no construyan a partir del inconsciente colectivo, de nuestro sentido del yo humano, si no que desde un desapego total del entendimiento descriptivo de la realidad misma. \nRespecto a los vaalores universales, creo que si es universal es por que existe en todas las dimensiones, por lo que seguramente parte de esta materia colorida que construia el entorno de mi alma mientras estaba en el utero de mi madre, era tambien reflejo de cierta paz que ella emanaba en lo profundo de su alma. Mi padre siempre me transmitio una paz especial, que podría ser compatible con un espacio como en el que existía mi alma en ese entonces.\nClaro que considero que lo que ellos compartieron conmigo en esa etapa, es muy valioso para la formacion del cuerpo denso y sutil de ese entonces. Ahora reflexionando sobre el tema, solo me nace agradecer por esta belleza y gran regalo que recibi, soy consciente que tienen que haber habido muchos estados entre ellos en este periodo, pero del igual manera, predominó cierta armonia.  \n\n\n   "

    "chapter": "As the golden light of dawn filtered through the curtains, Marcus found himself lost in contemplation, his mind drifting back to the spiritual encounters that had marked his global travels. He recalled the reverent silence of a Buddhist monastery in Japan, the pulsing energy of a shamanic ritual in Peru, and the profound stillness of a midnight meditation in India. These experiences, so far removed from his current corporate life, now took on new meaning as he pondered his impending fatherhood.\n\nAcross the room, Luna sat cross-legged on the floor, her rounded belly a gentle curve beneath her flowing sundress. Her hands moved with practiced grace, applying vibrant colors to the canvas before her. The artwork was a kaleidoscope of hues and symbols, each brushstroke a reflection of her spiritual journey. In the center, a radiant spiral represented the unborn child, a fusion of past, present, and future.\n\nMarcus approached Luna, his hand coming to rest on her shoulder. \"It's beautiful,\" he murmured, his eyes tracing the intricate patterns. \"A perfect representation of our path.\"\n\nLuna smiled up at him, her eyes sparkling with warmth. \"Our spirits are intertwined now, all three of us. This painting is a reminder of that connection.\"\n\nAs Marcus gazed upon the canvas, his thoughts wandered to the myriad of spiritual encounters he had experienced during his travels. He remembered the sense of awe that had washed over him as he witnessed the devotion of the Buddhist monks, their chants echoing through the ancient halls of the monastery. He recalled the raw power of the shamanic ritual, the drumbeats pulsing in sync with his heartbeat as he journeyed into the depths of his consciousness.\n\n\"Those experiences changed me,\" Marcus said softly, his voice tinged with nostalgia. \"They opened my eyes to the vastness of the spiritual world, to the different ways people connect with the divine.\"\n\nLuna nodded, her fingers tracing the spiral at the center of her painting. \"And now, as we prepare to welcome Anky into the world, those experiences take on new meaning. They become a part of the spiritual tapestry we'll weave for our child.\"\n\nMarcus smiled, his hand drifting to rest on Luna's belly. \"I want Anky to grow up with a deep appreciation for the spiritual, to understand that there's more to life than what we see on the surface.\"\n\nLuna leaned into his touch, her eyes drifting closed. \"We'll create that for him, my love. A home where spirituality is celebrated and nurtured.\"\n\nAs the days passed, Luna and Marcus began to infuse their home with elements of their spiritual practices. They created a meditation space in the corner of their bedroom, a tranquil oasis filled with soft cushions, flickering candles, and the gentle scent of incense. Each morning, they would sit together in silent contemplation, their hands resting on Luna's growing belly as they sent love and light to the tiny life within.\n\nDuring these moments of stillness, Luna often found herself reflecting on the spiritual practices of her ancestors. She thought of the stories her grandmother had shared, tales of women gathering under the full moon to honor the goddess, their voices raised in sacred song. She remembered the herbal remedies and ritual baths that had been passed down through generations, each one imbued with the wisdom of those who had come before.\n\n\"I want to incorporate some of those ancestral practices into our own spiritual journey,\" Luna said one evening as she and Marcus prepared dinner together. \"I feel like they hold such power, such connection to the past.\"\n\nMarcus nodded, his eyes shining with understanding. \"I think that's a beautiful idea. We can create our own rituals, ones that honor both of our lineages and the new life we're bringing into the world.\"\n\nAnd so, as the weeks passed and Luna's belly grew rounder with each passing day, they began to weave together the threads of their individual spiritual practices into a shared tapestry. They attended a birthing class that incorporated elements of mindfulness and visualization, learning techniques to stay grounded and centered during the intensity of labor.\n\nDuring one particularly powerful session, the instructor guided them through a meditation designed to connect with the spirit of their unborn child. Luna and Marcus sat facing each other, their hands resting on Luna's belly as they breathed in unison. As they sank deeper into the meditation, they felt a surge of energy passing between them, a palpable sense of connection to the tiny life that grew within.\n\nTears streamed down Luna's face as she emerged from the meditation, her heart overflowing with love and reverence. \"That was incredible,\" she whispered, her voice trembling with emotion. \"I felt Anky's spirit, so pure and bright.\"\n\nMarcus nodded, his own eyes glistening with tears. \"It was like a glimpse into the future, a promise of the love and connection we'll share as a family.\"\n\nAs the final weeks of Luna's pregnancy drew near, they began to prepare for the birth not only on a physical level but also on a spiritual one. They created an altar in the nursery, filling it with sacred objects and symbols that held meaning for them both. A statue of Quan Yin, the goddess of compassion, stood at the center, surrounded by crystals, feathers, and a small wooden box containing a lock of hair from each of their mothers.\n\n\"This altar will be a reminder of the love and protection that surrounds Anky,\" Luna said softly as she arranged the objects with tender care. \"A symbol of the spiritual foundation we're creating for our family.\"\n\nMarcus wrapped his arms around her from behind, his chin resting on her shoulder as he gazed at the altar. \"It's perfect, my love. A sacred space for our little one to grow and thrive.\"\n\nAs the due date approached, Luna found herself increasingly drawn to the altar, spending long moments in quiet contemplation as she communed with the spirits of their ancestors. She would light a candle and sit cross-legged on the floor, her hands resting on her belly as she whispered prayers of protection and guidance.\n\nDuring one such moment, Luna felt a sudden rush of energy coursing through her body, a powerful sense of connection to the generations of women who had come before her. She saw their faces in her mind's eye, a lineage of strength and resilience stretching back through time. And in that moment, she knew that Anky would be born into a family rich in spiritual wisdom, a child of the earth and the stars.\n\nWhen the first contractions began, Luna and Marcus moved through the motions of their birthing plan with a sense of calm and purpose. They lit candles, played soft music, and surrounded themselves with objects of spiritual significance. As the intensity of the contractions grew, Luna drew strength from the love and support of her partner, their spirits merging in a dance of creation.\n\nIn the final moments of labor, as Luna brought their child into the world with a primal cry, Marcus felt a rush of emotion unlike anything he had ever experienced. He watched in awe as Luna cradled Anky to her chest, tears of joy streaming down her face. In that moment, he understood the true power of the spiritual journey they had embarked upon, the depth of the love that had brought them to this sacred threshold.\n\nAs they gazed upon their newborn son, Luna and Marcus felt a profound sense of connection to the universe itself, to the great web of life that held them all in its embrace. They knew that the spiritual practices they had cultivated throughout the pregnancy had prepared them for this moment, had given them the strength and wisdom to guide their child through the many thresholds yet to come.\n\nIn the days that followed, as they settled into the rhythms of parenthood, Luna and Marcus continued to nurture their spiritual connection as a family. They blessed Anky with sacred herbs and oils, whispering prayers of protection over his tiny form. They created new rituals, ones that honored the sacredness of each moment, each breath, each flutter of his eyelids in sleep.\n\nAnd as they watched their son grow and thrive, Luna and Marcus knew that they had created something more than just a family - they had birthed a new way of being, a spiritual path that would guide them through the many twists and turns of life's journey. With Anky as their north star, they knew that they could weather any storm, could find beauty and meaning in even the darkest of moments.\n\nFor they had learned that spirituality was not something separate from life, but rather the very essence of it - the thread that wove them all together in a tapestry of love and connection. And as they gazed upon their child, Luna and Marcus knew that they had been blessed with the greatest gift of all - the opportunity to nurture a soul, to guide a spirit through the many thresholds of existence.\n\nAnd so, with hearts full of gratitude and wonder, they stepped forward into the unknown, ready to embrace whatever lay ahead. For they knew that they walked not alone, but with the love and wisdom of all those who had come before, and all those yet to be born. Theirs was a journey of spirit, a dance of creation that would echo through the ages, a testament to the enduring power of love and the indomitable resilience of the human soul.",

    "userFeedbackForChapter": ["This chapter seems to suffer from excessive repetition of the terms \"spirit\" and \"spiritual.\"\n\nThe sentence that resonated with me was: \"I want Anky to grow up with a deep appreciation for the spiritual, to understand that there's more to life than what we see on the surface.\"\n\nThis statement encapsulates the essence of the chapter.\n\nHowever, I found myself wanting more details in certain sections, particularly regarding the specifics of the \"new rituals\" they introduced.\n\nFurthermore, the chapter's tone struck me as overly sentimental, with an abundance of terms like \"joy,\" \"connectedness,\" \"embrace,\" \"dance of creation,\" \"tears of joy,\" \"rush of emotions,\" \"blessed,\" and so on.\n\nThis saturation of romanticized language felt somewhat artificial and detracted from my engagement with the narrative.\",\"holy shit i can't believe that Anky was born on this chapter. this was not supposed to happen yet, because this first resonance wave (8 day period on the ankyverse) is about the pre-natal stage.\n\nthis speaks about the importance of being more clear with the \"spinal chord\" that will guide the major actions that happen through the book, and to be clear about them in the instructions so that the AI can know what is what comes in that particular moment of the story.\n\ni get the feeling that the story goes too fast. from one chapter to the next one we jump to fast, and there is a lack of \"diving deep into what is happening in that period of the book\". it feels that it goes fast but it doesn't go deep into what is happening, and that ends up having the effect that it is not as interesting as it could be.\n\nthere is too much emphasis on the spiritual side of things (which in this chapter was extreme), and that ends up being boring. there needs to be more conflict, tension, and all the elements that give birth to a good story.\n\nthis is a fun exploration so far, but not a fun story. and it needs to be a fun story. as fun as possible. there needs to be a thread that ties everything together in a way that makes it appealing for people to read, not just for us that have incentives for that.\",\"As i read i have the feeling that the story is way too over-spiritualized to the point it becomes a bit boring.\nIn every (or almost every) paragraph you can actually find the word spiritual, spirituality or spirit.

        "I don't really know how to respond to this. In my last submission, I mentioned being Mennonite, a group not entirely unlike the Amish. Through my childhood my sisters always wore plain dresses, then changed to shirts and skirts with pants since doing manual labor in a dress is a little annoying. The other things is veilings, my sisters wore them, and my mother still wears them. I've not felt overly connected to these things, other than a dislike of wearing graphic tees or shorts, I never felt constrained by my clothing choices. I know that my parents value work, and that we should help others. Many times I volunteered to help at foodbanks or family friends who were older and couldn't do so much physical labor. Many times as a child I remember going with my mother to pick up food and deliver it to people who had a hard time getting out of their house, we still do this, though now with my physical health so degraded I don't do much heavy lifting, since I really can't. I remember going to church every sunday, we are a religions people. We also went to many",
        "My parents were vaguely religious, but the norm of the time was a conservative Christian coalition that carried much of the country in political battles. The Cold War was just coming to an end. Both my father and mother espoused Christianity to be their faith, but the were never fully steeped in the Church and its doctrines prior to us beginning to attend the Church that I would eventually go to school in. The need to question the doctrines of the Church was not something that ever particularly occurred to my parents I don't believe. It was left to me to discern what was valid and relevant in the Bible, and what was not. So I studied, and tried to understand the underlying precepts of morality, dogma, and religion. I don't think my mother had any deeper beliefs. She tends to shy away from concepts with deep philosophical meaning. Not that she can't mind you. She is extremely intelligent and perceptive, she just chooses not to engage in that sort of philosophical discussion. My father seemed to be far more religious and introspective, but he didn't seem to be any more knowledgeable. On the contrary, neither one of them knew their way around a Bible, or had even read the whole thing. It was always astonishing to me later how someone could supposedly center their life around a series of concepts, but have no personal familiarity with them. I found it to be tremendously intellectually inconsistent. I have never understood how they could send us to school to learn something that they themselves couldn't be bothered to learn despite the fact that their souls relied upon it.",
        "very interesting question about which again I don't have the slightest idea; My parents identify themselves, so to speak, as Catholics, however I don't really agree with it, on the other hand, at that time I don't know how close they would be to church, if they went to mass and things like that; Most likely yes, since my mom has always been more devout; and that my dad was going to accompany her, he has always been lighter, even contradictory to the -supposed- faith that she has. On the other hand, I don't think they had conversations about it, maybe my mom said a few prayers from time to time. Which would be in any case what I could be listening to. There is something very interesting about it and that is that what we hear in the womb does not come from outside, like other sounds, but from inside, through the bones and such, the vibrations are transmitted and that is how babies hear, the day they fell. Considering that, it seemed like something very \"mindblowing\" to me... since the voice would be heard very differently from how others hear it and even how the pregnant woman hears herself.\n\nAt this moment I'm thinking that these prompts would surely make someone angry who says that children in the womb are not people... what a strange and even irrational position that seems to me. I perceive a position in these prompts in which the person is appreciated from conception, and these days it is something very difficult to find. It is one of the things of these times that seem most barbaric to me.\n\nThat orange line takes so long... anyway that's how it happens. uuuu today I went crazy shopping with my sister, I bought a lot of things woouuuu, uniforms, school supplies, games and some rubik's cubes for me yaaay!!! It's very fun to go shopping with my sister... let's see if we can go again tomorrow because I want to buy some things for my nephews, Children's Day is coming up here. I want to buy you nice things =) I hope to find BBB... and I'll see you tomorrow if possible, bye",
        "How did these shape my connection with the subtle?\n\nwhat are these? What do I mean when I talk about these?\n\nWhen I was young, my parents were involved with the Catholic Church, and that is what I saw while growing up. I have memories of going to mass frequently as a child, and my parents always talked about \"God\" (but without being extremely religious in their spiritual work and practice).\n\nThe connection with that spiritual, divine energy generally came from outside. from an imposition, from a task that comes from what the world expects you to do, from what the world expects you to relate to. from what the world expects \"you should do when it comes to spiritual energy.\" but nothing beyond that. There was - and never has been - a spiritual energy underlying his work. It was never more than \"making the stop\" to go to mass, like a ritual that didn't have much meaning beyond the fact itself. It was not a ritual that I felt was something transcendent, but rather well, well, well anchored in the ego, and in the relationship of this ego with the rest, from the spiritual practice done and carried out to belong. to be part of something.\n\nThey went and went to mass because \"it was what they had to do.\" This reminds me of when I took the yoga course, and I saw many people who were there because \"they wanted to be yoga teachers.\" not because they wanted to directly and sincerely explore their relationship with spirit, which is what I consider a conscious spiritual practice, and carried out with the direct intention of raising consciousness.\n\nMy parents' spiritual practice while I was in the womb was never related to the elevation of consciousness, but rather to the anchoring of consciousness with the ego. through the ego.\n\nand from there, that touches my essence because it has led me to be connected with this ego even from spiritual practice. It has been difficult for me to carry out a spiritual practice that is completely absent of egoic expectation. It is always related - deep in my unconscious - with what the rest will think of me, or more than that, with an expectation. This spiritual practice is always related to expectation, and that is what is important to move towards understanding. towards receiving. towards hugging.\n\nWe embrace spiritual practice, and from that, we integrate it. I don't know what other universal belief my parents had, honestly. I can't imagine them having a conscious practice. I can't imagine them giving time to raising their spirit.",
        "My mother's womb was cold. Just 6 months ago she had given birth to a son, my brother. Prior to this, she had already had another birth and previously an apparently spontaneous abortion. I doubt the latter, it is a family secret. That first pregnancy was conceived out of wedlock, which for my father's and mother's families was inconceivable and completely disapproved of. So I was the fourth to be in that womb. As she said, at first it was cold, it took her several months to realize that she was expecting another child. When she did it she felt very afraid, the economic situation was not optimal. It was my father who managed to calm her down and convey her security. Beyond the fears and discomforts that I see in myself today, which I believe came from that first experience, there was also love, care, affection and a lot of joy in being the first woman, after two men. As much as I deny that today, I understand that it was a joy for them to know my sex. Furthermore, they are both religious people, believers, and today I see them as very spiritual, connected to their most sensitive side and with faith. They always believed that everything was going to be for the best, that things happen and you have to face them and do something to make it happen in the best possible way. Maybe my mother felt quite alone during her pregnancy, she is not from the city she lived in, that was my dad's family's city. Many, if not all, of her domestic tasks fell on her, two very young children, an ongoing pregnancy, no job, I imagine it was not the best scenario. However, all this is what I can see, because when I ask them, there are not many memories they have. Had they been blocked? There is something in the body that is wise and makes us forget moments that have happened.",
        "I believe that with respect to the spiritual atmosphere according to my understanding while I was in the womb, it may be something abstract without having a broad knowledge of the word, my universe at that moment or my world when I was inside the womb was limited, thinking that only There was that, it's like when a worm evolves into a butterfly, it feels afraid of the unknown while it doesn't know that it will end up being a butterfly. It's strange to think about what my parents were thinking at that moment, but I don't think they had that understanding either, least of all me. The truth is, I know that there is something that is outside our senses and that in the end I don't know so much about the subject that it is difficult for me to explain anything solid, obviously this spiritual atmosphere influenced them in some way, but knowing exactly what it influenced is super f . Complex to define, I believe that existence itself is perfect, everything happens for a reason, that universal plan obviously made life and my experience with that of my parents, be that way, but at the same time it is a plan that we do not know , everything led to what is happening today, now the fact of being writing here is part of that process, of the conooooooo. Connections that we have with our peers, and the fact that everything is planned or rather everything is perfect, seeking the balance between good and bad, we are energy, positive and negative, and that must be balanced in a certain way,,,, thinking In the question that is very deep, I must say that the influence that caused the spiritual atmosphere is simply unknown to me, I just accept it... thinking that everything happens for a reason, for this reason I think it is good to just accept and let go. to fight against what I do not understand and do not know c",
        "My parents were Catholic, practicing Christians. They raised themselves in those beliefs and values. My mother's womb was cold, just 6 months ago she had given birth to a son, my brother. At the time she became pregnant she was still breastfeeding him. Her energy was all devoted to raising this new son and her older brother. That is to say, it took her several months to register that new life was developing, that's what the puerperium is like sometimes. The record she had of her body was practically zero. The day she finds out about my pregnancy she lives with anguish and fear. Fear of not being able to give the children what they need. It is my father who manages to calm her down and convey her security. Nowadays, for them, these moments are moments that they say they remember happily. However, going deeper one can see traces of fear in his eyes and gestures. A fear that I also feel, mainly when starting new things. It is generally cold, could this fear be the fear of the first months in the womb when no one knew/recorded/was aware that it was there?\nI think so.\nThat fear is mine, but in reality it is my mother's fear and it is a transgenerational fear, because it is also her mother's fear.\nBeyond that, even though I denied the fact of religion for many years, I believe that its beliefs, its faith, and above all spirituality is something that was transmitted to me from pregnancy. Today, in my own way, in a very different way from theirs, which brought many problems and disagreements, I have a great spirituality. A great sense and taste for the mysteries of life. As well as this feeling that I had since, I would believe also since the womb, of not belonging. Not being welcome, not having to bother. Unnoticed. Fix it alone, without help. Like no one expected me.",
        "My mom comes from a more Catholic family, my dad not so much. My mother took you to mass when you were kids, she made us do our first communion, confirmation, etc. She showed us that world, we decided that we didn't belong in it. If my dad had gone to mass, perhaps we would not have considered anything else. I think it influenced that we had two different fronts to look at, and I think that is very enriching. There can be a mix between believing in something and not believing in anything, two extremes with many nuances in between. My dad is more scientific for his beliefs, seeing is believing, tests and things like that. It doesn't mean that he once had a splitting experience, the beginning of an astral journey, and it will surely have left him with questions.... but I think that's what he stopped at and didn't think about it anymore. I think they are both quite earthly and I don't think they believe in the multidimensionality of being, like I do. I say this because I have talked to them about it before and they don't engage in the conversation. The spiritual part does not move them much in that sense. But it does not matter. I believe that they also shaped my connection with the world by giving me those two extremes between the Catholic Church and the super scientific. I chose all the shades in between. I'm not really sure how to answer this question because the truth is that I don't know very well. The spiritual and existential atmosphere during my time in the womb....I went to mass safely! My dad wasn't there, or he wasn't there at least the last few months of my pregnancy... so I don't know that part very well. Spiritual existential..",
        "So, in my experience, or what I can remember of it. I could say that it was like being constantly guided like, in the way an umbrella guides your body through a rainstorm in order for you to stay (as much as you can) dry... That being said. My dad was a \"devout\" catholic most of his life. I would say that he still is today, but he would I guess technically fall closer (LOL) under the umbrella of a Lutheran in the sense that, in the eyes of a \"Roman Catholic\" like my dad wars raised to be, he would be considered lazy, in that he rarely goes to church, etc... Anyway, my mom on the other hand was for all intents and purposes, \"a black sheep\" so she was not a religious person, to say the least. With that being said, their love was above all, for me unbreakable at that point. All things considered, I am not sure they loved much else. The funny thing is, even today, if I were to mention my dad and say how he is \"doing well and feeling great\" or whatever, the look  in my moms eyes is just.... hard to explain. Like a sense of lost desire? Idk. The point is, my world views are very much that of a techno-hippie that has really just no clue what's going on at times, but really does their best. And to be honest, I am a little bit biased in my experiences, both in person, on the telephone, in web3, on the internet in general, I would say, people could stand to learn something from what I have experienced, from what I have seen and done and what has happened to me. The bottom line is though, I think that is true for everybody. Which, I also think clearly aligns me with what my parents would have hoped for me to be. The person I am is an accurate reflection of the compo",
        "I am not clear about the spiritual environment that existed during my pregnancy, I only know that my parents were quite religious, I mean not religious like they were active people in the church or anything like that. But they did get married in the church and they baptized us and put us in religious schools, etc.\nIn relation to deep beliefs, I am not so clear either because the truth is they were both very young, my mother was 20 years old and my father was 25 years old. Very young, but in the past it was normal for women to get married so young and to start having children at a young age.\nToday we went to a birthday party where most of the guests had children, some older or some smaller than mine, and I felt very nostalgic for not having a group of friends like that here, ready to invite to a barbecue and who would be with their children so they could share with the mila.\nSometimes I miss those things about Santiago and having more friends there, or maybe I feel like I have few and few friends with whom I interact on a daily basis. I feel that coming to live in the south and being a mother and being a partner of someone who does not like to interact much with others, has made me disconnect from that essence and that friendship that characterizes me... I mean, I don't know about the million friends and I am also not the one who starts a friendship or relationship. I feel, I feel that the other person is the one who gives the kick but is welcome.\nNow I miss having a fun little group to hang out with, like I feel like that should have been a group of childhood friends, friends that we had known all our lives, but I changed schools twice, so I wasn't there. always in the same school and I didn't always have the same friends.... so it is difficult to have an old consolidated group, what can be done is that it was a new group of friends, who had sons and daughters so that we were on the same page and could connect with the same stage and the same",
        "It is interesting to think of my parents beliefs. I never considered them religious people so their beliefs, at least as I interpret them are related to the way you love your life more than a set religious system. I definitely viewed my dad as a strait laced hard working type. As o got older and realized that a lot of his advise had been used to get myself out of trouble, I’ve started to wonder if he live a more nefarious life than I or many expected. He made sure to drive a work ethic into my brother and I which while I am thankful for as an adult, I am still not sure if it is worth the cost to the relationship with them as a child. I would not change my upbringing but I am also not sure that I am going to be able to instill the same drive and determination in my children, if I’m not willing to be the asshole it take to teach the lesson. My mom is a bit more of an enigma. I can’t specifically pinpoint an attribute that I have to her bother than my ability to jive with many different types of people. My mom always seemed like a go with the flow type of person, which is very much who I am, but it makes it hard to say that they specifically influenced you when they’re primary influence was what ever was needed at the time. It make my mom seem like",
        "Both my parents were quite \"spiritual\". My father however didn't want me, and I think I felt that in the whomb. My mother was extremely stressed all the time, and like many other people that are suffering, turned to \"new age\" beliefs. Which were really just a mash up of exisiting beliefs from various religions, saints, \"masters\", gurus, and fake teachers. The new age community is full of these fakes, but I was gullable as a kid, and carried a lot of these beliefs with me. As I got older, specifically in my later teenage years, I became quite intrigued with spirituality. I pretty much believed every single non sensicle thing out there. And I wasn't alone. In fact it was the norm in the communities I was a part of to believe the most insane, non- factual things because we were all suffering so much, we just wanted some semblance of peace, and of hope for a better life, or a better version of ourselves, usually both. This suffering is something every single person knows and craves to not have. But suffering is a part of life. Of course we have choice, to make things better for us or worse, but the circumstances we're born into , the countries, cultures, families and societies deeply impact the way we think- or the way we don't. And that was my biggest discvery 10 years ago= we dont knwo how to thinkf for ourseleves! THINK FOR YOURSELF!",
        "Good question. My assumption of what my parent's beliefs were include thinking of the future as a good place. my dad already might have thought that it would be a good idea to leave russia - a place that doesn't work on logic. it is interesting to note that years later, Canada does not work on logic either. maybe its just the human condition. even the greener pastures are not as green as they seem. my grandmother was very spiritual. she recited the Jesus Prayer in her mind. a practice held by the Old Believers, who were forced to hide their practices. maybe it was for the good. one must hide their spiritual work in order to continue doing it. maybe this is a human condition too. when we talk about our inner and outer achievements we may fall prey to egotism and narcissism. those things just catch us in their cradle and slowly shake us to sleep. and we dream that we are doing what needs to be done, but somehow we are not even close. another assumption perhaps by i do see it at least a little bit. life is a beautiful gift we have whichever the situation is. we can do so many things. we can create so much. but maybe only in scarcity. when we are out of water or free time, we start to think what to do. but of course if we are out of something, we may also drop into blindness and carry on until we die. human condition? some people strive to understand, even if it takes everything we got. but they keep going. composing a whole opera, finishing a play. maybe i should finish the book of short stories. something that is meaningful, so i can show how i see the world to others. life is a beautiful gift. don't go to quick, life, just go quick enough. do your thing, but don't run too fast. keep the heartbeat going. go with the tempo of the heart. life is good. love is good too. maybe that is the value that my parents had, keeping love inside the heart",
        "I think that the atmospheres that go back to that moment of my existence had reddish, yellow, green colors... like a lava lamp that moves slowly and hypnotizingly. This could represent a spiritual context since the shape the world takes is actually a reflection of our interior. And this inner reality projected on the outside, of course, still did not have a body, therefore, there was no matter capable of perceiving and storing forms and aspects of life in memory through a human body. Perhaps my parents had already made this matrix of colors more complex, in the ways that today society has agreed to describe reality, but they are just agreements. It is not a big deal to reconstruct it as we wish, the big thing is to be able to live individual experiences that are not built from the collective unconscious, from our sense of human self, but from a total detachment from the descriptive understanding of reality itself.\nRegarding universal values, I believe that if it is universal it is because it exists in all dimensions, so surely part of this colorful matter that built the environment of my soul while I was in my mother's womb, was also a reflection of a certain peace that she emanated from the depths of her soul. My father always transmitted to me a special peace, which could be compatible with a space like the one in which my soul existed at that time.\nOf course, I consider that what they shared with me at that stage is very valuable for the formation of the dense and subtle body of that time. Now reflecting on the subject, I can only thank you for this beauty and great gift that I received, I am aware that there must have been many states between them in this period, but in the same way, a certain harmony predominated."
