This must have affected my father and added a certain level of stress to their conversations. \n\nThey didn't know what they were doing. Or what they were getting into. The kind of commitment that children would require -- they were clueless, as most people are. People have children because its the natural path of progression. Or maybe they are excited by the idea of a person, a small reflection of themselves, to mold and shape. They think of these things but fail to imagine the day-to-day responsibilities. The responsibilities that will go on for a lifetime. \n\nBut that's a tangent. Back to my parents. How did this affect me? The anxiety of my mother. The pushback from my father.

Or, at least that is what I would assume. The fact is, both of my parents love and loved me, however the primary problem with their love and affection was that it was not based on a love and affection that they had received as children, it was instead based on the contrarian perspective (more or less) as they, at least at that time in their lives, had yet to learn to love themselves. I can attest to this as a 34, going on 35 year old father. I know with all of my heart that I have loved my wife and children for the entirety of their being and will love them no matter what they do or say in this life, however that doesn't change the fact that I too (while they were young) only had a clue at best as to what \"loving myself\" even meant. I can say wholeheartedly that without my wife and kids, I was certain that I would not be here today, learning HOW to love myself, and HOW to engage with loving others. For a long time I was sure that my parents in fact, hated me, as the primary memories I have was of them fighting. They were never disgusting, if you don't mind the use of the word in its most basic form. Think of disgusting like a very just unpleasant feeling or sensation that is not enjoyable, and less like \"dirty dishes in the sink\"- The bottom line is, they were both barely out of their adolescence and I truly believe that had my Dad been born in my shoes, he would've prospered much more than he did by being born when he was.

They dance, their movements synchronizing with the beat, their bodies moving closer until they are pressed together, skin to skin.\n\nBut even in this moment of connection, there is a tension that underlies their interaction. Luna, with her free-spirited nature and artistic soul, communicates through movement and expression, her body a canvas for the emotions that swirl within her. Marcus, on the other hand, is more reserved, his words measured and his emotions guarded.\n\nAs the night wears on and the festival reaches its crescendo, Luna and Marcus find themselves in a quiet corner, away from the pulsing crowd. They talk, their voices barely audible above the distant thrum of the music.\n\n\"I'm glad we found each other in this chaos,\" Luna says, her eyes shining with a mixture of excitement and vulnerability.\n\nMarcus nods, his brow furrowed in concentration. \"It's...it's been a long time since I've felt this alive,\" he admits, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nLuna reaches out, her fingers gently brushing his arm. \"Tell me about it,\" she murmurs, her gaze open and inviting.\n\nMarcus hesitates, his eyes darting away. \"I... I don't know where to begin,\" he says, his words halting and uncertain.\n\nLuna studies him, her expression one of patient understanding. \"That's alright,\" she reassures him. \"You don't have to have all the answers.\" She leans in, her breath warm against his cheek. \"Just be here with me, in this moment.\"\n\nAs the night wanes, Marcus and Luna find themselves drawn into a deeper conversation, their words flowing more freely as they share their dreams and fears. Luna speaks of her passion for art and her desire to create a nurturing, expressive environment, not only for herself but for the life growing within her. Marcus listens intently, his eyes reflecting a longing he can barely contain.\n\n\"I... I've always wanted that,\" he confesses, his voice barely above a whisper. \"To feel... connected. To something bigger than myself.\" He pauses, his gaze shifting to Luna's belly. \"To someone.\"\n\nLuna reaches out, her fingers intertwining with his. \"Then let's create that,\" she murmurs, her eyes shining with a quiet determination. \"Together.\"\n\nIn the days that follow, Luna finds herself reflecting on their encounter, her mind replaying the moments they shared. She thinks of the way Marcus looked at her, the intensity in his gaze, and the way his touch ignited something deep within her. But she also remembers the way he held back, the way his words seemed measured and controlled.\n\nAs Luna moves through her days, she becomes increasingly aware of the life growing inside her. She places a hand on her belly, feeling the flutter of movement beneath her skin. She knows that this child will be a part of her forever, a piece of her heart walking outside her body.\n\nBut with this realization comes a sense of fear, a worry that she will not be able to provide the nurturing environment she so desperately wants for her child. Luna reflects on her own upbringing, on the way her parents communicated with her and with each other. She remembers the silences that stretched between them, the words left unspoken, and the way it left her feeling disconnected and alone.\n\nLuna knows that she wants something different for her child, a home filled with love and laughter, where communication flows freely and emotions are expressed without fear. She begins to seek out ways to create this environment, surrounding herself with music and art, spending time in nature and letting the beauty of the world fill her senses.\n\nAs she walks through the bustling streets, Luna finds herself drawn to the vibrant murals adorning the walls of a nearby community center. Stepping inside, she is greeted by the warm smiles of a group of children, their eyes sparkling with excitement. Inspired, Luna begins to facilitate art workshops, her own joy and creativity sparking a similar flame in the young participants.\n\nIn these moments, Luna feels a profound sense of purpose. She watches as the children translate their innermost thoughts and feelings into vibrant expressions on paper, their laughter and shared enthusiasm filling the air. It's a stark contrast to the silences and unspoken words that had haunted her own childhood.\n\nAs the weeks pass, Luna's belly grows, and she becomes increasingly intentional about the environment she is creating for her child. She seeks out other expectant mothers, drawn to their stories and experiences. In their shared moments of vulnerability, Luna finds a sense of kinship and support, a reminder that she is not alone in her journey.\n\nOne crisp autumn morning, Luna stumbles upon a flyer for a community gathering in the park near her apartment. Intrigued, she decides to attend, hoping to forge new connections in this strange city. As she arrives at the park, she is greeted by the warm smiles of her neighbors, their faces reflecting the diversity of the urban landscape.\n\nLuna finds herself drawn into conversations with other expectant mothers, their shared experiences bridging the gaps of language and culture. They exchange stories of their hopes and fears, their laughter mingling with the rustling of the fallen leaves. In that moment, Luna realizes that she is not alone in her quest for a nurturing, communicative environment.\n\nAs the gathering progresses, Luna observes the women's varied communication styles, some expressive and effusive, others more reserved and introspective. She marvels at the richness of this tapestry, each thread contributing to the whole. It is a stark contrast to the silences and unspoken words that had defined her own upbringing.\n\nIn a quiet moment, Luna finds herself drawn to a young mother named Maria, her warm smile and open demeanor instantly putting Luna at ease. As they talk, Luna shares her fears and anxieties about becoming a parent, her own experiences of feeling disconnected and alone.\n\nMaria listens intently, her eyes reflecting a deep understanding. \"I know it's not easy,\" she says, her voice low and soothing. \"But you have to remember that there's no one way to be a good parent. The most important thing is to create a space where your child can feel loved, heard, and free to express themselves.\"\n\nLuna nods, a sense of relief washing over her. \"That's what I want for my child,\" she murmurs, her hand resting protectively on her belly. \"A home where communication is celebrated, not stifled.\"\n\nMaria reaches out, squeezing Luna's hand. \"Then trust your instincts,\" she says, her eyes shining with encouragement. \"You've got this, mama.\"\n\nAs Luna walks home, she finds herself filled with a renewed sense of purpose. The community she has discovered has not only provided her with a support system but has also opened her eyes to the myriad ways in which communication can be expressed and nurtured.\n\nYet, as she reflects on her own relationship with Marcus, Luna can't help but feel a twinge of uncertainty. Their connection had been electric, their shared moments of intimacy deeply meaningful. But their communication styles had clashed, their words often falling flat, their emotions seeming to vibrate on different frequencies.\n\nLuna knows that she needs to reach out to Marcus, to share the news of their child's impending arrival. But the thought fills her with a sense of trepidation. What if he is not ready? What if he cannot meet her in the space of open and vulnerable communication that she so desperately craves?\n\nAs the days pass, Luna's belly continues to swell, the life within her growing stronger with each passing moment. She finds solace in the quiet moments, when she can escape the noise of the city and immerse herself in the beauty of the natural world. It is here, amidst the towering trees and the whisper of the wind, that Luna feels most connected to the life she is nurturing.\n\nOne crisp autumn afternoon, Luna finds herself drawn to a secluded cove on the beach, the rhythmic lapping of the waves calming her restless mind. As she settles onto a weathered driftwood log, she closes her eyes and begins to trace an invisible mandala, the ancient symbol of harmony and balance.\n\nWith each line and curve, Luna feels her breath slowing, her mind clearing. She reaches deep within, connecting to the primal wisdom that resides in the very marrow of her bones. In this sacred space, she contemplates the future that lies ahead, the role that communication will play in shaping her child's life.\n\nLuna knows that the path forward will not be an easy one. The silences and unspoken words of her own childhood have left a deep imprint, a shadow that she must confront and release in order to create the nurturing environment she so desperately desires. But as she gazes out at the endless expanse of the ocean, she feels a deep well of courage and determination rising within her.\n\nWith a steadfast resolve, Luna reaches for her phone, her fingers trembling as she scrolls to Marcus's number. She pauses, her heart pounding, before pressing the call button. As the line connects, she takes a deep breath, her words spilling forth in a rush of emotion.\n\n\"Marcus... I need to talk to you. It's... it's important.\"\n\nIn the bustling city, Marcus sits at his desk, his eyes glazed over as he stares at the glowing computer screen. The numbers and data before him blur together, the endless stream of information a poor substitute for the visceral experiences that had once filled his life.\n\nUnbidden, his mind drifts to the music festival, the memory of Luna's vibrant presence still searing in his mind. He can still feel the electricity that had passed between them, the way her touch had ignited something deep within him. But even as the memory warms him, a deep sense of unease settles in his stomach.\n\nMarcus has always been a man of logic and reason, his emotions carefully guarded and his words measured. But in the face of Luna's raw expressiveness, he had felt woefully inadequate, as if he were stumbling through a foreign landscape without a map.\n\nAs the days pass, Marcus finds himself increasingly drawn to the memory of that night, his thoughts consumed by the what-ifs and might-have-beens. He knows that he should reach out, to try and bridge the gap that had opened between them. But the fear of vulnerability, of exposing the deeper parts of himself, holds him back.\n\nIt is in these moments of quiet reflection that Marcus is forced to confront the ghosts of his own upbringing. He remembers the silences that had defined his childhood, the unspoken emotions that had hung thick in the air, suffocating any semblance of true connection.\n\nMarcus had vowed, long ago, that he would not repeat the same patterns, that he would be the father he never had. But the prospect of fatherhood now fills him with a paralyzing sense of dread. What if he cannot break the cycle? What if he is doomed to perpetuate the very same communication barriers that had haunted him for so long?\n\nJust as Marcus is about to retreat further into his shell, his phone springs to life, Luna's name flashing across the screen. He hesitates, his finger hovering over the answer button, before finally succumbing to the pull of her voice.\n\n\"Marcus... I need to talk to you. It's... it's important.\"\n\nIn the quiet intimacy of their conversation, Luna pours out her heart, her words carrying the weight of the life that grows within her. Marcus listens, his own emotions rising to the surface, a torrent of joy, fear, and uncertainty threatening to overwhelm him.\n\nAs Luna's voice trails off, Marcus finds himself grappling with a newfound sense of responsibility, a profound realization that his actions and his ability to communicate will have a profound impact on the life of this child. It is a daunting prospect, one that challenges the very foundations of his carefully constructed persona.\n\nBut as Marcus reflects on the connections he had forged with Luna, the moments of vulnerability and understanding that had flickered between them, he feels a glimmer of hope. Perhaps, together, they can create the nurturing environment that had eluded them in their own childhoods, a space where communication is celebrated and emotions are embraced.\n\nWith a deep breath, Marcus steels himself, his fingers trembling as he types out a response. It is a simple message, but one that carries the weight of a new beginning, a promise to step into the unknown and to embrace the challenges that lie ahead.\n\n\"I'm here, Luna. Let's do this... together.\"\n\nIn the days that follow, Marcus and Luna find themselves navigating the uncharted territory of their newfound connection, their communication a delicate dance of vulnerability and trust. They share their fears and dreams, their words sometimes stumbling, but their eyes reflecting a deep understanding and a shared determination to create a better future for their child.\n\nAs the season shifts and the leaves begin to turn, Luna and Marcus find themselves drawn to the community gathering in the park, their hands intertwined as they move through the diverse tapestry of expectant parents. In this space, they witness the myriad ways in which communication can be expressed, from the boisterous laughter of a young mother to the quiet, contemplative moments shared between partners.\n\nIt is in these moments that Luna and Marcus begin to truly see the power of open and authentic communication, the way it can foster a sense of belonging, support, and mutual understanding. They watch as the women share their stories, their words flowing freely, and they feel a palpable shift within themselves, a newfound courage to embrace the vulnerabilities that had once held them back.\n\nAs the gathering draws to a close, Luna and Marcus find themselves drawn to Maria, the woman who had offered Luna such sage advice. In her warm embrace, they find a reflection of the nurturing environment they so desperately seek to create, a space where communication is not merely a tool, but a means of connection, growth, and self-discovery.\n\nIn the quiet moments that follow, Luna and Marcus begin to map out the foundations of their own communication, their words and actions a reflection of the lessons they have learned. They know that the path ahead will not be an easy one, that there will be moments of frustration and uncertainty. But in the depths of their shared gaze, they see a glimmer of something profound, a promise that, together, they can build a home where their child will thrive, where communication is not a barrier but a bridge to a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them.\n\nAs the sun dips below the horizon, painting the sky in vibrant hues, Luna and Marcus stand hand in hand, their hearts filled with the hope of a new beginning. They know that the journey ahead will be filled with challenges, but they also know that they are no longer alone. With the support of their newfound community and a determination to break the cycles of the past, they are ready to embark on the greatest adventure of their lives \u2013 the journey of parenthood, where every word, every gesture, and every moment of connection will shape the life of the child they have created.", "summaryOfChapter": "Chapter 4 captures a poignant moment of connection between Luna and Marcus amidst the dynamic backdrop of a music festival. Their paths cross, drawn together by an unspoken bond, and they navigate the crowd to find each other in a world pulsating with life and music. Their interaction is charged with the raw energy of potential and the stirrings of deep, yet unarticulated feelings.\n\nThe narrative dives into the contrasting personalities of Luna and Marcus. Luna, vibrant and expressive, lives in the moment, her movements a reflection of her inner freedom and artistic spirit. Marcus, in contrast, appears more reserved and contemplative, his internal struggle evident as he is drawn to Luna\u2019s vivacity yet restrained by his own guarded nature.\n\nTheir meeting evolves into a dance of intimacy and hesitancy, where touch and movement become languages of their unvoiced desires and fears. The festival setting amplifies the intensity of their connection, highlighting the possibility of a profound bond forming between them. Their conversation, though fragmented by their emotional barriers, starts to bridge the gap between their worlds, offering glimpses into their hopes and the life they could create together.\n\nThis chapter delves into the complexities of human connection, portraying the dance of communication and miscommunication, and the universal quest for understanding and companionship. The festivity of the music festival mirrors the chaotic beauty of human relationships, where moments of connection can be both fleeting and deeply impactful.\n\nLuna and Marcus's evolving relationship stands as a metaphor for the broader theme of the narrative: the search for meaning, connection, and authenticity in a world that often feels disconnected and transient. Their journey together, marked by the shared night at the festival, becomes a crucible for their individual transformations and the potential for a shared future, setting the stage for deeper exploration of their bond and the challenges they will face together.", "userFeedbackForChapter": "[\"Noticed that some imagery is being reused, sometimes word for word. Luna\u2019s red hair in the breeze, paragraph about conversations with expectant mothers, drawing the mandela in the sky, being drawn to Maria.\n\nSo did Marcus not answer the call and texted back instead?\n\nOverall I though the characters and story are starting to develop. Definitely wasn\u2019t to make sure there\u2019s an over all plot.\n\nThis chapter seemed to be just a bit wordy. It\u2019s feels like it tries to be as poetic as possible with every line, which can get in the way of the story and be tiresome to read.\n\nDef like where it\u2019s going.\",\"Chapter 3 spoke about the hardships that Luna was going through in terms of being a single mother, and now we have her and Marcus coming together to grow Anky together. There needs to be a tighter line in between these, so that the story can have meaning and a thread that we can follow.\n\nIt is obvious that these are tapestries that are woven with each other, but they are not a thread that continues from one chapter to the next one. This needs to be fixed.\n\nIt is clear that this chapter's focus was in the importance of communication, and that was the topic of the prompt from which people wrote their streams of consciousness. I missed more clear communication in the form of dialogue, and it will be important that key moments of the story are shared through that. For example, when Luna told Marcus that she was pregnant, this could have been a great moment to showcase the different \"styles of communication\" that they have, given their upbringing.\n\nThis could be another opportunity to showcase their differences, and use contrast as a vehicle for showcasing the point of this chapter (the importance of communication and openness in the unfolding of humans).\n\nIn other terms, it is unclear why we start on the festival again. Is it another festival than the one where Anky was conceived? Why are they on a festival again? Perhaps it could be a concert instead of a festival, so that this difference could be more clear.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the thread that ties together all of the circumstances of the book, which is not happening yet. We need to move towards that, and probably training this ai model will help.\"]", "jpComments": null, "translated_userWritings": ["I can only imagine that the communication environment between my parents before my birth was immature. My parents were children. They grew up in small towns. They new little of the larger world. I imagine there was excitement, but also anxiety, especially on the part of my mother. She was and is and anxious personal. Always worried. Always thinking about what might happen and imagining the worst. This must have affected my father and added a certain level of stress to their conversations. \n\nThey didn't know what they were doing. Or what they were getting into. The kind of commitment that children would require -- they were clueless, as most people are. People have children because its the natural path of progression. Or maybe they are excited by the idea of a person, a small reflection of themselves, to mold and shape. They think of these things but fail to imagine the day-to-day responsibilities. The responsibilities that will go on for a lifetime. \n\nBut that's a tangent. Back to my parents. How did this affect me? The anxiety of my mother. The pushback from my father.

This also creates a good taste in music. Sensitivity and admiration. Nothing better than walking and admiring life, nature, the environment listening to music. Communication, the legacy of my parents taught me humility, respect, pride.", "The communication environment before my birth was definitely a tumultuous one. Or, at least that is what I would assume. The fact is, both of my parents love and loved me, however the primary problem with their love and affection was that it was not based on a love and affection that they had received as children, it was instead based on the contrarian perspective (more or less) as they, at least at that time in their lives, had yet to learn to love themselves. I can attest to this as a 34, going on 35 year old father. I know with all of my heart that I have loved my wife and children for the entirety of their being and will love them no matter what they do or say in this life, however that doesn't change the fact that I too (while they were young) only had a clue at best as to what \"loving myself\" even meant. I can say wholeheartedly that without my wife and kids, I was certain that I would not be here today, learning HOW to love myself, and HOW to engage with loving others. For a long time I was sure that my parents in fact, hated me, as the primary memories I have was of them fighting. They were never disgusting, if you don't mind the use of the word in its most basic form. Think of disgusting like a very just unpleasant feeling or sensation that is not enjoyable, and less like \"dirty dishes in the sink\"- The bottom line is, they were both barely out of their adolescence and I truly believe that had my Dad been born in my shoes, he would've prospered much more than he did by being born when he was.

That's what's in me when I think about my parents when it comes to being inside my mother. There wasn't much communication. there wasn't much room to embrace what there was. my dad, a lot of work. my mom: alone with herself. probably without the ability to converse with many people. and that ends up being drowning. She probably spent a lot of her time drowning in her, with a lot to say, a lot to vomit, but not much space to do it. without much space to find herself by recognizing in herself what needed to be worked on. what was there to feel. What did you have to have? Probably for a long time she had no one to talk to, and that finally ended up causing her to not have much where to meet. where to hug.\n\nmuch that was not spoken. many words that were kept, and that finally makes me keep what is inside.

However, I can go back to those times when the internet or cell phones did not exist. Communication was by telephone, usually disk. Those phones seemed too aesthetic and fun to me, the sound when dialing each number and when the dial returned to its initial rotation; I still remember it clearly, of course I'm talking about a few years later, I didn't listen to it when it was still in gestation. Anyway. I like that sound a lot, it makes me nostalgic, now I want one of those phones or at least make a piece with one of those, I mean art. I think that's what I'm going to paint right now, because I feel like painting. Another \"old\" sound that I love is that of the internet dial when it was by phone, that glitchy beep that sounded to connect; I loved it then and I still love it now. I wish I could take a sip of my coffee but I don't know if I'll miss the session, so I hold on for another 3 or 4 minutes. I like my coffee hot or cold, or even frozen. But not boiling, I always burn myself, I don't understand who in their right mind can enjoy boiling coffee... but everyone, as they say; There will be those who don't like cold coffee. What I have not been able to do is reduce the sugar further, at least I am now at a teaspoon; When I started drinking coffee many years ago I gave it a 4. In fact I still give it a 4 when I make it frapped in the summer; I also put milk and vanilla in it, sometimes other things if there are in the house, like vanilla frosting or I don't know, experiments, cinnamon sometimes, things like that that go with coffee. I already wanted a Bayleis frappado with coffee, what a delight. In fact, it's hot today, if you're craving something like that, but I already made my normal hot coffee, but with milk, I rarely crave it black; I don't know what makes me think it's black.

My Mum told me that i was an easy baby, the birth was straight forward, no complication, I was an easy baby and I think that message    gave me a deep pattern of always be well behaved and not making a fuss.", "My parents were together at the time, and I know there was a certain expectation of being (almost certainly) the last and female.\nI can't know how they communicated, since I don't physically remember being there. Yes, I have pleasant feelings of family and love then. From my perspective, it is difficult to analyze with waking consciousness how this environment could have affected me, since perhaps not even my receptor organs were available to store that information in a readable way in my adulthood. What I do believe is that in some way my soul was present in this physical body, even before its full development, so there is memory about this then, and not only memory, but learning, experience and emotion linked to it. . What I'm not sure is how we access this, without manipulating it with the intervention of my current mind.\nI believe that the form that this memory takes in my life is through deep meditation or conscious observation, with a great willingness to go to the past of my spirit in this incarnation.\nI remember colors, reds, oranges, yellows. I can feel music, and my mother's sweet voice, her gratitude for my arrival, her patient waiting for her. I feel your love", "My parents in general are not very good at talking, at expressing their emotions and thoughts a lot through words. If they do it more through actions, how they take care of others or the details they have with them. I inherited a lot of that. I have learned to speak and express my emotions and communicate over time. It has been difficult for me but I have learned, since I saw that \"lack\" in my parents. I think it is very good to communicate and not keep things to yourself, because in the end they stay there and accumulate. By this I do not mean that they have not expressed themselves at all about my arrival. I feel like they would be very happy and expectant, my sister too. They probably told him about my arrival and made him touch his belly and stuff. My parents are very loving. Now that we are older we have more fluid communication regarding deep things. I remember when I was a teenager that communication was more difficult. I think I always kept many things to myself, I don't know if because of the example I received from them, yes, it could be. I always thought I would bother others with my things, and why go around telling what happened to me or worried me. I remember friends reproaching me because I didn't tell them things, because I didn't share my sorrows and joy with them. I was always a very good listener, yes, I was always there, and people like to tell me things, and they trust me a lot. In that I will not go with the gossip or to tell what they have told me", "I don't know anything about my parents' communication. My mother has a hard time asking for help. What I know from later stories is that they didn't know much about each other. I think they rarely if ever shared their feelings. which led to me not familiarizing myself with my feelings either. I don't know many different feelings and had to learn late to name, localize and tolerate them. I think if my parents had discussed their feelings more and given them more space, I could have learned a lot. Today I try to teach my children this and teach them what feeling comes over them and how to deal with it. To this day, my parents cannot communicate and tolerate feelings well. And yet I am very different from my brother. I think in the womb my mother communicated a lot about how she felt, but I can't say to what extent that shaped me.", "My family has always been very consistent is our decisions. While I was in the womb my mom had been working at a company for almost 5 years at that point, eventually she retired with that same company after more than 40 years. My dad seemed to be more of the dreamer, as far as aspirations go. At the time he was flying small general aviation planes, delivering paychecks. I don't know why it never went further than that regarding a career. During that time he was also transition from working for a construction painter to operating his own painting business. After getting that established, he continued that for almost 40 years before he passed. So I don't know if their aspirations were always to have stability, or if that was just the easiest way to ensure my brother and I had everything we needed. When I was born my parents lived in a trailer home, shortly after I was 3 they purchased a house, so I assume they were wanting peruse the American dream. They picked the town we ended up growing up in based on its location between their two jobs. One thing seems evident that they had always maintined a strong work ethitic throughout.", "My father was a survivor in the Vietnam war. Our family is part of the very last dynasty, and my Great grandfather was the last empire in all of Vietnam. During my time in the womb, my father was concerned with the after math of the vietnam war, and freeing his country... whatever that means. My mother owner a store, and was deeply in love with my father. I think he cared for her too, at least for a while. She was driven and focussed on creating a successful buisiness, while simultaneously infatuated with my father. He wasn't a bad man, but he's also not a good man. My father never wanted me ,he told me so. I think I felt that very early on. I've mostly felt quite alone in life, and my circumstances as a child of what it meant to be in the world were very much dominated by the constant feeling of loneliness. Of course there were times that were beautiful too- but I perceived the world from a very isolated perspective. Me and me alone in the world. Yes, my Mom was there, and I had babsitters, and eventually friends and boyfriends, but the feeling not being seen has been something my parents influenced since the beginning!\\", "i don't know. and this is not what i feel like thinking about. not that there is anything wrong or important about it. i really wish they were asked and i wish i was asked about my experience. visualisations of the possible is ok, my assumptions about other people are not the most interesting part of my space. its just there, like the weather, like the noise of cars, so what? what i do know is my experience, how i move through the rain, how i dance when nobody's watching except the big tech, how i pick strawberries. i just walk or i run, i  inhale air, I jump up, I sing, I pretend I throught sing. but not properly. anyway. there is more to the way we assume things about people. what am i is more interesting. there was a dog in the nail salon. i saw it ponder i did not know what. the old Altai is probably covered in snow this late in spring. i miss seeing its streets and smelling its air. what else can i add? maybe that my early perceptinos were influenced by my parents but every single impression after i left home piled up on it and the only thing that can freshen up the pallet is silence. silence may be key to sweating in a sauna not being able to afford it. parents are still around and they may know more about what they felt. what do i feel now? i feel satisfaction from the cake today in a coffee shop but a dissatisfaction from the state of the world. i walk in this direction, but the direction changes because of the axis of earth moving. i hope bees and cicadas stay for as long as they can. i hope they keep being in charge. the droning sound can stay here for free for as long as it can.", "My mother was 42 years old when I was born which was unusual 74 years ago. We were called \"change of life\" babies and were mostly a surprise especially as I was the third child. They were struggling to get buy then as they did not have a car and they lived in a somewhat remote place. I grew up appreciating the fact that we had enough food to eat and clothes to wear, were always well cared for.     This carried on to my own children. They had more than I had growing up but were not spoiled so now, as adults, they recognize the value of money.  \nMy parents were also immigrants from Canada so that was added pressure to assimilate, another factor that I recognized growing up. My father was totally bi-lingual but my mother refused to  speak English (they were French Canadian) so I became the de facto intrepreter for"], "translated_userFeedbackForChapter": []}
