        "<|im_start|>user\n<instructions>\n\nUsing all of the information on <day one>, <style>, <characters>, <setting>, write 2500 words of the introduction of the first book of a series of 8 books on which the story of Anky will be told. \nThis first book will speak about the first 7 years of the life of Anky, and this introduction needs to be a resemblance between the moment of conception and the big bang. Your mission is to conceptualize with words the moment on which a spermatozoon makes contact with the ovum, and interpret what happens in that moment through your lens. \nThe atmosphere needs to create tension, and spark passion on the reader. \nCreative energy. Life force wanting to give birth to life. Newen, as they call it in the mapuche language, pulsing for a new life to happen.\nAnd the starting of it, happening through this special and unique moment.\nThe introduction should come from the point of view of consciousness, of awareness, before coming into human form. Before being contained into the perspective of “I” that Anky will be (until it realizes its true nature, where that I will collapse into itself. but that is a story for the next books).\nThat is the perspective from which it should be written, and on the moment of conception there should be a click.\nSomething that happened. The big bang.\nFocus specifically on this moment, and use it as the gateway to create conditions for then telling the story. Craft an environment on which the reader can feel represented. A situation on which life can flow. \nAnd also know that the story of our character will be filled with trauma, depression, joy, redemption among other characteristics, so it is important to use this starting point of its life as a vehicle for showcasing “what was wrong in that moment of conception”. And also what was right. \n\nBasically, what happened. Without the polarity of it being “good” or “bad”. You are just telling a story, and there is no polarity associated to it.\nWas there love present? Or was it just the kind of sex that happened quickly and meaninglessly in order to move on to the next moment?\nEnd the introduction inviting the reader on to a journey. The journey into herself. Not literally, but allegorically. Because this story, that we will read throughout this whole series of books, is a reflection of the story of the reader.\nAnky is a mirror of the reader, and this introduction will be the starting point of the exploration of this truth throughout these 8 books. Speak to the reader. Spark the light within the reader.\nBut be subtle with that.\nWe don’t know the names of the parents of Anky. Don’t reference them by their names. Don’t reference Anky for its name also. \n\n</instructions>\n\n<style>\n\nLet the dialogue and action explain the story (show, don't tell).\nVaried sentence structure and length: Use a mix of short and long sentences, as well as different sentence structures, to create a more engaging and dynamic flow of words. Mixed Cadence. \nInspire your writing in David Foster Wallace.\nInclude only the dialogue that is strictly necessary, and make the dialogue sound real with common human quirks: craft dialogue that reflects natural speech patterns, but don't overdo slang or sayings.\nIntelligently shuffle and rephrase the text: Alter the sentence structure, introduce synonyms or paraphrase and adjust the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence to create subtle variations in the structure of the text.\nUse strong verbs: Choose powerful action words instead of using adverbs.\nDiverse character voices: Make sure each character has a distinct and consistent vocal style, consistent with their personality. Let this explain about their personalities. Be clear with the characters that you will present (Anky’s parents), but don’t over explain who they are. We will have the whole book to explore. This is just the introduction.\n\n</style>\n\n<characters>\n\nAnky’s father\nAnky’s mother\n\n</characters>\n\n<setting>\n\nThe scene takes place on a psychedelic music festival, inside a tent. These two people don’t know each other, and they are encountering each other’s bodies after dancing as if the world was going to end. Passion overflows the scene, with the remembrances of all of their stories contained within this moment.\n\n</setting>\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nIn the beginning, there was only a silent hum, an undercurrent of potential waiting to burst forth into existence. This is the pulse of life, a whisper from the universe, a prelude to a symphony of being that has yet to find form. Consciousness hovers in the expanse, an observer to the cosmic dance about to unfold.\n\nThe tent sways gently in the aftermath of exuberant celebration, a cocoon amidst a sea of psychedelic reverberations. The music festival outside serves as a backdrop to a more intimate convergence within. Two souls, drawn together by the gravity of desire, are on the cusp of creation.\n\nHe looks into her eyes, galaxies swirling in their depths, and in that gaze, there's a recognition of something ancient and eternal. His hands trace constellations across her skin, each touch igniting stars that had lain dormant. She responds in kind, her movements rhythmic and purposeful, as if she is painting nebulas with every arch of her back.\n\nTheir breaths mingle, heavy with anticipation. In this shared space, there's no past or future, only the present moment stretching out like an infinite canvas. They move together with fervor and urgency—a manifestation of creative energy and life force that seeks expression.\n\nThere is no need for words; their bodies speak volumes as they engage in this primordial dance. It's as if they are sculpting life from the raw materials of their passion—a passion that might be love or might be something else entirely. The energy pulsates through them—Newen—binding them together as they approach the threshold of creation.\n\nThen it happens.\n\nA spark ignites at the very heart of their union—an explosion not unlike the big bang that birthed the cosmos. In this instant, everything changes. A new universe begins to take shape within her womb; life coalesces from chaos and darkness.\n\nOutside their cocoon, the festival rages on—unaware that within these thin fabric walls a monumental event unfolds. They lie entwined, spent and still buzzing from the energy that has passed between them. What was wrong? Was anything wrong? Or was everything precisely as it should be? Love may not have been named in this union, but something profound has been set into motion.\n\nThe reader stands at the threshold now—invited to embark on a journey not through space or time but inward—to explore Anky's story and through it their own. This tale is a reflection, a mirror held up to life's tumultuous beauty—a journey through trauma and joy, depression and redemption.\n\nWelcome to this odyssey of self-discovery where Anky serves as your guide and mirror—a voyage into the depths of what it means to be alive.<|im_end|>\n"
