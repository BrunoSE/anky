Obviously I don\u2019t have any memory of my first breath or even if I did I don\u2019t think babies have the mental capacity to interpret energy. Of course that is the logical part of my mind telling me that the brain isn\u2019t sufficiently developed to even perceive the self until many months have passed. However, I have also done things in my adult life that make me think that we don\u2019t have an understanding of how we as humans perceive and interact with the world around us. I have developed a slight spiritual side after having panic attacks. I\u2019m not speaking of a religious belief, but more a hypothesis that the human mind IS able to affect the way the body functions and may even have abilities that science has not determined. So I would be ok to find out that there is a measurable energy in the universe that humans can or can learn to tap into that we as a species just don\u2019t have the tools to verify. So my first breath must have been an open window from a university that had a yoga room next to it.

I have empathy for those around me but I always try to do what I can to make my world better while doing what I can for everyone else.   As long as my children are successful in their lives, I feel like I have done a good job with the breathes I have taken. I am not insensitive to the needs of others but I have never been a great philanthropist. I give to various causes as I can such as St Jude's Children's Hospital as I had a sister who died of leukemia at the age of 5 and I know how that took a toll on my parents. I am not a metaphysical sort of person who looks for the grand meaning of life. I am a Virgo which means I am more interested in the here and now and how I can survive day to day. If I end the day with a good meal and a warm bed that is a success to me. I am not altruistic but I do give money to FIND food bank and to the Animal Shelter as I believe in sharing what I have with others.

Like a fire that burns me inside. I just finished my morning meditation session, and I feel this fire burning inside. I feel that all this \"struggle\" that I am going through in terms of the relationship with myself and my environment, is empowered, strengthened and navigated by this infinite capacity that we have to give life. this infinite capacity I have to fight. That first breath gives life to this struggle, to this curiosity, to this desire to love life to the fullest, to the limit. this desire to want to burn myself from the inside out, bringing everything that is unconscious to the conscious. bringing to what is here everything that is good to give life. recognizing in this life the gift it means to be able to be. notice. recognize.\n\nperhaps that first breath was surrounded by curiosity. or came with a deep desire to say: HERE I AM. GHHHJGAJHAJSHJFHAJS. That is what I feel, and that is always repeated in my experience: that eternal desire to say: here I am. here I am present. Here I am bringing everything I have here as an offering for life.\n\nhere I am, at your service. That is something that I forget, and that I don't keep in mind enough, and that I don't have here. enough. that desire to make myself seen. to recognize myself, and to say: here I am. This vital force has guided my life from a deep recognition that there is a fire. a fire that guides my walk. a fire that makes me have an existential need to create. to manifest. to give life.\n\nthis fire that gives life. this fire that I recognize. this fire that is here, and this fire that belongs to me. that moves.\n\nThis force clearly manifested itself in me when I played ball, and I had that enormous and unsatisfied desire to win. That desire to be recognized is expressed in competitiveness, and in the desire to run and let off steam.\n\nThere is a huge desire to vent, and to bring to this moment the ability to give life. to recognize in life. to open life. to feel life itself. to embrace life itself, and to recognize it in my actions.\n\nWhat moves me is the exploration of the truth. the search for that truth. in my experience. in the lives of others. the observation of others, from the energy of curiosity. I think about that first breath and ask myself: what do I bring to the lives of others? How do I relate to others through that life that happens? How do I move towards relationships with those others? How does that life feel? how is it expressed? how does it manifest? how is it that you invite yourself? That is what this exploration brings to me, day by day. It brings a deep desire to want to live in service of others. to recognize myself in others. to open the lives of others, and from that be able to live mine to the fullest.<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nReflect on the energy of your first breath: how has this vital force shaped your life's journey and presence?

Of course, presenting ourselves with the elements will always have enormous strength behind it, since they are honest encounters, which determine the life or death of the individual.\nSurely there was determination in this act, since allowing part of the fundamental substrate to enter for the rest of my life meant a renunciation of one's own weakness and absolute dependence on the mother.\nIt also means that there was already a deep will to live at that time, something that at the time I believed was a characteristic of all living beings, and today I realize that this is not the case.\nLife wants to live, but just as there is this awareness towards life, there is also awareness towards death.\nI remember the phrase from the Tao that refers to the fact that when beings are born, they are soft and soft, like babies and fine grass. When humans die they become stiff and hard, the grass breaks and dries up. To serve life, we must become soft and flexible. Whoever serves death, maintains its rigidity and hardness.\nSomething like that.

I would have died without medical intervention.

I never thought much about the importance of the act of breathing. Now at this point in my life, I am on a conscious breathing and sound project. We do that in the sessions we offer, bringing breathing to a conscious level. Breathe deeply and long, not agitated and shallow. Something very important for the functioning of our body. Something that we know how to do perfectly when we are born and something that we forget throughout our lives for whatever reasons. Nobody tells you it's important, you don't stop to think about the act of breathing, you just do it. Breathing is an automatic action. What we can shape at will is the act of breathing, how we breathe. The deeper and longer, the more life. Prana, the vital energy. If we breathe deeply we allow oxygen and Prana to reach every corner of our body, bathe each of our cells, reach all organs and tissues. When I close my eyes and breathe deeply, connected there in the present moment, I feel free, I feel good, I feel extremely connected to everything...even though the second I can return to the whirlwind of life, that moment is sublime, it makes me feel alive and confirm that we are more than a physical body.

In fact, my Mom and I both almost died. She wanted to have a home birth, but it wasn't working out. She says her coxic bone wouldn't open, so she was rushed to the hospital where she was given a cizerean section. So my first breath was probably one of trauma. Both mom and baby were stressed, so I imagine I came out gasping for breath, or holding my breath. Those breath patterns remain the same today. It's something I can learn to change but haven't yet. I think I probably entered this world frightened and curious. Frightened not knowing what is happening, and curious because so much is happening. I think the thing that stirs me deeply, connecting me to that initial surge of life, is life itself. Being here, alive, is not something that can be explianed in words. It's a feeling.

Moment of pure life, beautiful deep and subtle life. That first breath in which I was not alone, my ancestors, generations and generations of women, were with me. I was born a woman, I am a woman and for a long time I denied being one, but I understood, over time. I don't deny being a woman, what I hate are the injustices that being a woman brings. the injustices and violence that being a woman brought.

A vital force of mine and of the women of the clan who have fought, who have sustained themselves, they have accompanied each other, they have made a home and a bonfire.

I am a woman, and every time I menstruate this energy of the first breath of life resurfaces, to remind me once again that in that blood, which they made us believe is shameful, that we hide ourselves with modesty, that we do not have to show ourselves, that blood It is Power, the power to create and build from our womb. I had that teaching the day I was born, that I gestated in a uterus and that I myself had a uterus in which I could gestate and give birth, not only human children, gestate and give birth to projects, creative and creative force. Strength, power, power. I move with subtlety and disappear but I am attentive, present, constant, and I transform with that energy that is mine and everyone's.

Remembering that we came to learn and to complete the bigger picture sometimes helps. Instead, the ego is often too big and gets in the way. My daughter didn't breathe for a long time but instead cowered against my chest. She didn't want to give up her connection to her mother. She started life very slowly and quietly.

But as I stand here in this birthing room, watching Luna ride the surging tides of her body's primal wisdom, I realize that nothing about this moment can be contained or quantified. It's a wildfire, a supernova, an alchemical transmutation that defies all rational understanding.\n\nThe air is thick with the scent of sweat and the sharp tang of something I can't quite name\u2014the first whiff of new life waiting in the wings, perhaps. Luna sways in the corner, her face a shifting landscape of concentration and surrender as the contractions build and crest and recede. Maria, her birth doula, presses firm hands into the small of her back, a human anchor in the maelstrom of sensation.\n\nI feel like an interloper, an outsider witnessing a sacred rite I have no script for. My palms are slick, my heart a jackhammer in my chest. I want to go to Luna, to offer comfort or encouragement, but my feet are rooted to the floor. I'm paralyzed by the enormity of what's unfolding, by the raw power of this dance between agony and ecstasy.\n\nMy mind, ever the escape artist, flits back to the conference room I left behind just hours ago. The crisp lines of my suit, the cool gleam of the mahogany table, the measured cadence of my own voice as I delivered the quarterly reports. In that world, I am master of my domain, the king of my own tidy kingdom of spreadsheets and projections.\n\nBut here, in this crucible of blood and sweat and primal screams, I am stripped bare. Every carefully cultivated layer of identity\u2014the businessman, the provider, the man with the plan\u2014is peeled away, leaving me raw and exposed. In the face of Luna's elemental strength, my own power feels flimsy, a paper sword brandished against the tempest.\n\nI think back to my own birth, to that first gulping breath that set the whole improbable journey of my life in motion. I've always credited that initial surge of life force with my drive, my ambition, my inexhaustible need to prove and achieve and conquer. It's what propelled me out of the modest circumstances of my childhood, into the hallowed halls of academia and the cutthroat arena of corporate success.\n\nBut as I stand here, bearing witness to the awesome feat of life's emergence, all of my hard-won triumphs feel hollow. The late nights hunched over textbooks, the ruthless climb up the ladder, the ceaseless pursuit of some illusory brass ring\u2014it all crumbles to dust in the face of this moment's monumental truth.\n\nBecause this, right here, is the real brass ring. The luminous mystery of love made flesh, the sacred responsibility of shepherding a new soul through the thickets of existence. Suddenly, the fire that has always driven me, the restless energy that's never found satisfaction in any accolade or acquisition, makes perfect, blazing sense.\n\nIt was all just a prelude, a training ground for this singular moment of reckoning and revelation. All the trials and triumphs, the fears and doubts and secret shames\u2014they were the fuel for this phoenix fire, this incandescent awakening to my deepest purpose and power.\n\nLuna cries out, her voice a siren's song, a primal summons from the very heart of the universe. Her body is a conduit, a vessel for the life force itself, and I am awestruck by the immensity of what she is doing, of what she is. In the crucible of her courage, I feel my own dross burning away, all the false identities and limiting beliefs transmuted into gleaming, molten gold.\n\nI see now that the power I've spent my life chasing was never outside myself, waiting to be grasped and hoarded. It was always here, in the marrow of my bones and the chambers of my heart, a seed of divinity waiting to be ignited by love's fierce grace.\n\nAs I move to Luna's side, taking her hand in my own trembling grip, I feel that seed burst into blossom. The conflagration in my chest roars to life, a wildfire of tenderness and protectiveness, of awe and unspeakable gratitude. In the light of that blaze, everything is illuminated, every fear and doubt burned away like mist before the rising sun.\n\nI am a man transfigured, a phoenix rising from the ashes of his own self-imposed limitations. And as I look into Luna's eyes, those fathomless pools of strength and surrender, I know that this is just the beginning. That the journey we are embarking on together will demand everything of me, will call me to heights and depths of courage and compassion I can scarcely imagine.\n\nBut I am ready. Ready to be scoured and shaped by the holy fire of this love, to be forged anew in the crucible of fatherhood. Ready to meet my child not as a man diminished, but as a man expanded, a man whose heart has grown three sizes in the span of a single, shimmering moment.\n\nThe contractions are coming faster now, each one a seismic shift, a tectonic plate giving way to something new and uncharted. Luna moans, low and guttural, a sound that seems to rise from the very core of the earth. Her face is a study in concentration, every muscle and sinew recruited in service of this final, heroic push.\n\nAnd then, in a rush of fluid and glory, our daughter slips free. Her first cry splits the air, the sound of life asserting itself, of spirit triumphant over the throes of bodily passage. Maria places her on Luna's chest, still shuddering from the tempest of her arrival. Tiny mouth rooting, miniature hands grasping, she is the most profound miracle I have ever witnessed.\n\nAs I reach out to touch her, to trace the gossamer whorls of her ears and the satin-soft expanse of her skin, I feel the last of my defenses crumble. The fortress I've spent a lifetime constructing around my heart, every buttress and battlement of cool rationality and emotional distance, dissolves like salt in the ocean of this moment's grace.\n\nI am laid bare, cracked open, rendered new by the tidal force of my love for this tiny, perfect being. And in the space left behind, in the fertile soil of my own unmasked vulnerability, I feel something take root and unfurl. A new kind of strength, a new kind of power\u2014one born not of dominance or control, but of surrender and service.\n\nThis is the power of the father, the power of the heart in full and glorious bloom. It is the power to nourish and protect, to guide and cherish, to meet each moment with the full measure of my presence and devotion. It is the power to stand in the fire of my own unfolding, to embrace the man I am becoming with every breath and every beat of my daughter's fierce, fluttering heart.\n\nAs I cradle Anky in the crook of my arm, marveling at the impossible softness of her, the world seems to tilt on its axis. The future stretches out before us, a landscape of infinite possibility limned in the golden light of this new day dawning. I know there will be challenges, obstacles, moments when I will falter and fear that I am not enough.\n\nBut I also know that I will rise to meet them, again and again, fueled by the love that burns at the very center of my being. The love for my wife, my partner, my North Star, who has shown me the meaning of true strength and unflinching grace. The love for my daughter, my tiny teacher, who will guide me onto paths of growth and discovery I cannot yet fathom.\n\nAnd the love for myself, for the man I am becoming, forged in the fire of this magnificent and terrifying responsibility. A man who is learning, day by day and breath by breath, to meet life with an open heart and an unwavering commitment to his own evolution.\n\nAs I breathe in the sweet, milk-and-honey scent of my daughter's skin, I feel a profound sense of homecoming, of arrival in a place I never knew I was longing for. This is the brass ring, the treasure beyond measure, the ultimate alchemy of blood and pain and glory.\n\nThis is the true purpose of that first defiant breath, of the fire that has burned in my belly and driven me over peaks and through valleys. To arrive here, in this shimmering moment of redemption and possibility, cradling the living proof of love's transformative power in my arms.\n\nThe road ahead is long and winding, a hero's journey through uncharted lands of the heart. But I am ready for it, every step and every stumble, every moment of fear and triumph and transcendent joy. \n\nBecause I know now that I am walking it not alone, but hand-in-hand with the two souls who have shown me the meaning of love in all its raw and resplendent truth. And guided by the light of their grace, there is no path I cannot navigate, no challenge I cannot meet with the full force of my courage and my freshly-galvanized conviction.\n\nSo let the journey begin, this great and sacred adventure into the wilds of the human heart. Let the fire of my love light the way, a beacon in the darkness, a reminder of the infinite power and potential that lives within us all.\n\nI am a father now, a partner, a man reborn in the crucible of life's most profound miracle. And with every breath and every beat of my new-expanded heart, I vow to rise to the challenge, to meet this mantle of love with all the strength and tenderness that I possess.\n\nFor I know now that this is what I was born for, what every trial and triumph has been preparing me for. To stand in the fire of my own endless becoming, and to shepherd new life through the thickets of a world that is both heartbreakingly beautiful and achingly imperfect.\n\nIt is a task that will demand everything of me, a sacred calling that will shape and refine me in ways I cannot yet imagine. But I am ready for it, every inch and every ounce, every fear and every failing transmuted into fuel for this great and luminous love.\n\nSo I hold my daughter close, breathing in the miracle of her, and I let the tears come, the laughter, the whole messy and magnificent spectrum of emotion. This is what it means to be alive, to be human, to be cracked open and rendered new by the awesome power of love in all its myriad forms.\n\nThis is the journey of a lifetime, the hero's quest that ends not in conquest, but in surrender to something far greater than myself. And as I take my first steps into the golden dawn of this new chapter, my heart full to bursting with gratitude and awe, I know beyond all knowing that I am exactly where I am meant to be.\n\nA father. A partner. A man on fire with the love that will light my way, now and forevermore. A man who is finally, blessedly, coming home to himself, one breath and one beats at a time.\n\nSo let the journey begin, this grand and sacred adventure of the heart. I am ready for it, every step and every stumble. Ready to embrace the man I am becoming, the father I am called to be.\n\nReady to walk through the fire, and emerge on the other side, forever altered by love's most holy and transformative grace.<|im_end|>\n"]}
