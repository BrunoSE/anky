There are intense vibrations that even sound. Like bells in multiple tones from the lowest to the highest.\nIndeed, it could be called a dance, because the dynamism of the movement could be summarized in waves and vibrant rhythms that excite the matter until it becomes subtle, at the same time that the subtle spills out like a liquid, which is then poured into a clock. sand, where these small rock particles rub together, creating an immense orchestra, in which all the elements participate in dancing.\nIt is difficult to say where they conjugate. Where does the soul finally settle?\nThis toroid of contractions of the energetic flow generated the dynamism that allows the soul to inhabit matter, the river that runs, without beginning or end, the healing sound of flowing water.\nIn this infinite multicolored alchemy, there are several witnesses. The sacred elements, ancestral grandparents that gave way to life, grant the virtue of the living being.\nA display of virtues occurs, in a centrifuge of colors. A soup of the cosmos, nesting a soul.

I knew of all the suffering that I was going to face.... because that suffering that was happening through my body and that at that moment I did not understand or label, was very intense.\nI knew that I was going to have to relive it to be able to process it, because it was a lot... But I also knew that processing it was going to free me from one of the greatest traumas that humanity experiences.\nBeing born is difficult. But it may not be.\nIn fact...processing my birth was what opened the door for my daughter to come into this world. And she heals. without that trauma. A beautiful birth... in every way. Prepared, she was very prepared.\nMy birth was also prepared, but from a clinical perspective. Not from the spiritual energetic plane... which is too important.\nUnderstanding all the energies that happen in that moment and everything that surrounds it... or getting closer to that understanding (because it is too much) is very important. It is something that humanity has to pay too much attention and intention to. It is VERY important that babies are born in an environment prepared to be as natural and powerful as possible. In harmony... that the mother feels contained... by the people and by the physical space...\nIn my case, she was not like that... I was born in a clinic. All clinical... Little soul and sensitivity to the process of the mother and son daughter... It hurts. The birth of humanity. How most humans are born hurts. And we have to get in there. Deeply heal our connection with death and birth. Death and re-birth. Heal the layers that connect us to that trauma.

I imagine myself squeezing through a very narrow tunnel, not understanding much of what it's all about, I hear voices in the distance, I only recognize my mother's. I don't see much, my eyes are glued shut, my body feels wrinkled, there is a force that keeps pushing me through that tunnel. And suddenly, I go through it completely, and there is a lot of light outside! So much light that blinds me, my eyes accustomed to darkness, my ears accustomed to uterine silence, to echoes submerged in water. There are a lot of noises out here, my lungs suddenly fill with something I don't know and it hurts or surprises, I get scared and cry, but then comes a whirlwind of love that releases my mommy's heart when she hugs me, brings me close. his warm chest and I know everything will be okay. The people who are there seem happy about my arrival, of course, so much effort to leave and there I am finally, I would also celebrate,...it is not easy to be born. That atmosphere of joy invades the room where I am, several hands touch me, clean me, wrap me. I was born, and I don't understand anything, I don't understand much of what this game is about, I don't agree. I also don't know very well how to handle this vehicle that I'm in, it's difficult to move these limbs that I can only half see, because I still don't see very well. But that will change over time. I am excited to think about this moment of my birth, I don't think I had ever thought about it. It's something I have no memory of, but I was there! How would it have been?

My mother told me that she had a very bad time during my birth and that I was not with her for several hours after she was born.\nBut I want to play and imagine it differently, how I would have liked life to have received me.\nI would have liked to arrive at a place where my mother was happy about my arrival, that she was afraid, yes, fear is part of life and especially of situations as transformative as bringing a life into the world. And with everything that it implies physically, which implies an openness and on the other hand, emotionally since after 9 moons, the time finally comes to see his face, feel his smell, touch his skin to be able to imagine and dream that that little being was inside my mother, who was on the other side of the skin. a barrier so fine but so complex to cross.\n\nI would like my birth to have been, regardless of whether it had been a vaginal birth or a cesarean section, that it had been loving, respectful, that my mother had felt loved and protected, that she had felt comfortable, and that the people around her had , they could calm her anxiety or fear, respecting her time, answering if she had questions, caressing her if she wanted. I would like to have arrived in a warm environment, with low lights, rich smells, silence, love.\nI would like my dad to have been there as a guardian, respecting the space, not interfering if my mother didn't want it, being very perceptive, respecting the need or not to be caressed, respecting the silence when she required it or answering questions if she needed it.\nI would like them to have pastel colors, pink, purple, light blue, white, love, lots of love and affection, joy, excitement.\nThat fear was mobilizing and not paralyzing, that it was the driving force to be able to live that experience with enjoyment.\nThat I could have been with my mother from the moment I was born, that I could have felt her warmth, her heart, her skin and her smell from the first moment I walked through the portal. that she hadn't heard anyone, that she could hold me in her arms, that she could breastfeed me as much as she and I wanted, that it wasn't necessary for them to take me to sleep somewhere else because I just needed to be with her, to feel safe.\nThis didn't happen like that, but I dream of you being outside.\nThis was not like that at the birth of my precious little Mila, but I dream that it was like that, the connection we have goes beyond everyone, beyond how she was born, beyond, it is pure love,<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nImagine the dance of energies at the time of your birth.

They go from red, to yellow, passing through violet and then when calmness arrives turns green. When all is settle it will stabilize on a blue color. There was some kind of vortex. A center of energy were a spiral would surround it. Energy moving upwards in one direction and downwards to the other but always passing through the center. You can visualize it as a magnetic field where you will have sort of this circumferences or ovals marking the magnetic field. Added to this, there will be this cylindrical spirals around my body which would be like the magnet and this cylindrical spirals would go around my body / the magnet. \n\nSo in some way there is a balance of energy but maybe because they pulsate from one pole to another, going into the extremes but always passing through the balance point. Not staying in one extreme but rather, like a pendulum, swinging from one extreme to the other like an oscillation. \nThe beauty of this is that each oscillation would be more in balance and less extreme than the one before, and this can be fractally compared or better said as an analogy of life itself.

Some people live their whole lives operating under the same construct, which I can never fully understand. What that means is, the color and emotions always mean the same things, at least to me. When, were I not so much come from, but am coming from, is, that without the expansion of ones mind, to the ideas of the \"other\" how else can one welcome new ideas to the fold? I posit, its the constant re-evaluation of ones own circumstances and analyzing them, that can be sufficient in producing change. That being said, the colors that come to mind are red, blue, yellow, white and another  color... but all together in one stripe of color. Emotions are an enigma wrapped in puzzle. I think that concentrated matter at the point in the universe during the early phases of constructing my awareness, had a major impact on the matter or, lack thereof inside of my head. I cannot make sense of much with the concept of perception and what that entails, but the connections I have made and been able to make have been definitely impacted by my experiences at all times. More often than not, I use my emotions as a guide for whether or not I am in the right \"head space\" for different things. I spent a long time trying to reject emotions and still recovering from that. Which<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nImagine the dance of energies at the time of your birth.

Creatively speaking, I think it was my Mom getting creative with persuading her unconscious to have me despite knowing on some level, my father would not be around to raise me. I think on my father's side it was likely mostly lust. He already had 3 other children, and was going behind their mothers back to have an affair with mine. I suppose that took all kinds of creativity to keep so many secrets and constantly have to be so secretive and manipulative. I  think the only thing that sparked in that moment of conception was my fathers sperm entering my mothers egg, fertilizing me. Perhaps, my father learning of my conception was carefully planning how he would keep this secret, knowing deep down there would be no way to keep me a secret forever. Likely, his mind must have been very creative to make anyone come to terms with not being in their offsprings life. Or, perhaps there was no creativity at all. Perhaps there is no such thing as free will, and it was all written in stone before hand. But I find that hard to believe considering we have choice... or maybe we just think we do. I think likely my father at the time was focussed on his dedication to his country, and in his words \"getting it back\". My father went through immense turmoil through the Vietnam war, more than anyone can imagine, including myself. I think deep down he is a decent man, but his circumstances and his thinking have left him to be a very limited man.<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nImagine the dance of energies at the time of your birth.

Draw inspiration from those writings, and use them as the foundational ground over which you will write this chapter.\n\nBegin with Luna in the throes of labor, her narrative voice pulsing with the primal rhythms of her contractions. Describe the kaleidoscope of colors and emotions that surge through her with each wave - the fiery colors of passion, the deep sounds of creativity, the radiant elements of joy. Explore how these hues blend and dance within her, mirroring the fluid energy of the second chakra. Explore how she feels. Explore what is happening within her.\n\nHighlight the sacred space of the birthing room, a sanctuary where Luna feels safe to surrender to the powerful forces moving through her. Or maybe not. Decide what is going to be the energy that fills this space. Does she feel secure? Does she feel in danger?\n\nIllustrate how the room's atmosphere reflects the second chakra's qualities - the soothing warmth, the soft textures, the gentle light. Or Show how this environment supports Luna's instinctual process, allowing her to tap into the ancient wisdom of her body. Or maybe not. You decide.\n\nIntroduce Maria, the birth doula as a grounding presence, a nurturing guide who helps Luna navigate the intense sensations and emotions of labor. Describe the doula's (Maria) calming touch, her words of encouragement, her gentle reminders to breathe and release. Show how this support enables Luna to stay centered in her power, to trust the natural unfolding of her body's intelligence.\n\nAs Luna moves deeper into the heart of labor, explore the profound connection she feels to all the mothers who have come before her, the unbroken lineage of women who have journeyed through the portal of birth. Describe the ancestral strength and wisdom she draws from this bond, how it fuels her courage and determination.\n\nCapture the intimate moments of connection between Luna and Marcus, the wordless exchanges of love, awe, and shared purpose. Show how their partnership takes on new depth and meaning as they witness the miracle of their child's arrival. Highlight the vulnerability and raw emotion that Luna experiences, and how Marcus's steady presence anchors her.\n\nAs the intensity builds to a crescendo, describe how Luna surrenders completely to the overwhelming sensations, embracing the burn and the ecstasy, the pleasure and the pain. Illustrate the primal power of her final pushes, the guttural cries torn from her throat, the superhuman strength summoned from the very core of her being.\n\nAnd then, in a glorious rush of relief and wonder, let Luna describe the moment of birth itself - the incredible pressure releasing, the slick heat of her baby's body emerging, the tidal wave of love that engulfs her as Anky takes her first breath against Luna's chest. Capture the pure, unadulterated joy of that first meeting, the recognition of a soul she has always known.\n\nIn the sacred hush that follows, show how Luna drinks in every detail of her newborn daughter - the silken skin, the downy hair, the miniature fingers and toes. Describe the rush of fierce, protective love that floods through her, the primal bond that snaps into place. Explore the profound shift in identity Luna undergoes in these first moments of motherhood, the way her entire world realigns around this new life.\n\nAs Luna guides Anky to her breast and feels the tug of her first latch, capture the sense of wonder and rightness, the realization that her body was made for this divine purpose of nourishing and sustaining her child. Describe the waves of oxytocin, the blissful calm that settles over her as she provides this first, most elemental act of mothering.\n\nShow how, in the afterglow of birth, Luna reflects on the enormity of the journey she has just undertaken. Let her marvel at the strength and resilience of her body, at the depths of power and potential within her. Explore how the experience has cracked her open, stripped her down to her rawest essence, and rebuilt her anew.\n\nEnd with a sense of the profound transformation that has taken place within Luna - not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually. Show how the birth of her daughter has also birthed a new version of herself, one who is more fiercely loving, more deeply connected, more truly alive. Let the final words reflect the sense of wholeness and fulfillment that Luna feels, the unshakable knowing that she is exactly where she is meant to be.\n\n</instructions>\n\n<style>\nThe narrative should be richly evocative and deeply sensual, immersing the reader in the raw, visceral experience of birth from Luna's perspective. The language should be poetic and rhythmic, echoing the primal cadences of labor and the fluid energy of the sacral chakra.\n\nUse vivid imagery and metaphor to bring the scenes to life, painting the colors, textures, and sensations in lush detail. Let the words pulse with the life force of birth, carrying the reader on the waves of Luna's contractions and emotions.\n\nThe tone should be intimate and unflinching, capturing both the ecstasy and the agony of the birth experience. Luna's voice should be authentic and vulnerable, exposing the depths of her psyche as she moves through this transformative rite of passage.\n\nIncorporate elements of stream of consciousness to convey the non-linear, dreamlike quality of labor, the way time distorts and reality shifts. Let the narrative ebb and flow with Luna's changing states of consciousness, from moments of keen focus to expansive altered awareness.\n\nThroughout, maintain a sense of reverence and awe for the sacred mystery of birth, honoring the profound power and beauty of the feminine creative force. Let every word be infused with the love, passion, and primal wisdom of the sacral chakra, celebrating the sensual dance of life in all its intensity and glory.\n\nBut be careful of not being \"too spiritual\".

The air is sweet with the scent of essential oils - ylang-ylang, rose, and jasmine - their heady fragrances mingling with the primal aroma of birth. Soothing music plays softly in the background, a hypnotic soundscape of drumming, chanting, and flowing water, echoing the ancient rhythms of the womb.\n\nIn one corner, an altar is adorned with sacred objects - a statue of a voluptuous goddess, a bowl of ripe, juicy oranges, a vase of vibrant sunflowers.

The sensation is at once familiar and utterly foreign - a primal burning that sears through my deepest tissues, demanding surrender. I ride the crest of the wave, breath hissing through clenched teeth, hands gripping the sturdy wooden beams of the bed frame.\n\nIn the soft golden light of the birthing room, time becomes elastic, each moment an eternity unto itself. The hues of the space wrap around me like a cocoon - warm terracotta and rich sienna, punctuated by the vivid orange of the ripe fruits on the altar in the corner. Their heady scent mingles with the aroma of jasmine and rose oils that anoint my skin, grounding me in the earthy, sensual energy of this sacred space.\n\nMaria, my birth doula, is a steady presence at my side, her calloused hands cool and soothing against my flushed skin. \"Breathe, mija,\" she murmurs, her accent lyrical and strangely comforting. \"Breathe and let go. Tu cuerpo sabe - your body knows.\"\n\nI focus on the rhythm of my breath, letting it sync with the hypnotic drumming emanating from the speakers - an ancient Amazonian beat that seems to echo from my very bones. Each inhalation draws the energy of the room into my lungs, into my blood; each exhalation releases the tension, the fear, the resistance. Little by little, I feel myself opening, softening, yielding to the powerful forces that surge within me.\n\nMarcus, too, is here, his tall form an anchoring presence at the edge of my awareness. In the brief spaces between contractions, I find his dark eyes, seeing my own awe and trepidation reflected back at me. No words are needed; the bond between us is palpable, a shimmering cord of love and shared purpose that buoys me as I labor to bring our child into the world.\n\nAs the contractions intensify, I lose myself in the dance of sensations, surrendering to the primal power that moves through me. Flashes of color explode behind my closed eyelids - deep, pulsing crimsons and fiery oranges, spiraling and twisting in mesmerizing patterns. I am a conduit, a vessel, a portal between worlds; the energy of creation thrums through my veins like molten gold.\n\nDistantly, I register the sounds escaping my throat - low, guttural moans that vibrate through my entire being. My voice is wild, untamed, a feral song of instinct and raw feminine power. There is no room for thought, for logic, for control; there is only the moment, the wave, the unrelenting pressure building at the base of my spine.\n\nAnd then, in a blinding flash of clarity, I am back in my body, poised on the precipice between worlds. The urge to push is overwhelming, a force as primal and unstoppable as the tides themselves. I bear down with every fiber of my being, feeling the impossible stretch and burn as my daughter's head emerges into the world.\n\nOne final, gargantuan effort, and she slips free in a rush of heat and relief, her cry piercing the hushed air of the birthing chamber. Shaking, I reach for her, drawing her slick, vernix-covered body to my chest. She is perfection incarnate, a swirling galaxy in miniature, her dark eyes ancient and knowing as they meet mine for the first time.\n\nAs she latches onto my breast, I am suffused with a wave of bliss so profound it borders on ecstasy. Oxytocin, the nectar of the gods, flows through my bloodstream, erasing the raw edges of sensation, leaving only a glowing sense of wholeness in its wake. This is rapture, benediction, apotheosis; I am transformed on a cellular level, reborn in the crucible of my daughter's arrival.\n\nIn the golden afterglow of the birth, I marvel at the strength and resilience of my body, at the mythic power of the feminine that has moved through me. My skin hums with residual energy, a pulsing vitality that coils and dances like honeyed sunlight in my veins. Every atom of my being vibrates with the primal knowing that I have touched the face of the Goddess herself, that I have danced in the swirling forge of creation and emerged remade, triumphant.\n\nMarcus's hand finds mine, his touch an anchor in the overwhelming sensation of the moment. Our eyes meet, brimming with unshed tears, with the sheer immensity of the love and gratitude that flows between us. No words are needed; our hearts beat in synchrony, euphoric and replete.\n\nI drink in the sight of my daughter, marveling at the silken perfection of her skin, the dark swirl of hair plastered to her delicate skull. She is the fulfillment of a promise whispered long ago in the secret chambers of my heart, a pledge of love and life renewed. As I hold her close, I know that I will spend the rest of my days striving to be worthy of the profound gift I have been granted - the opportunity to guide this incandescent new soul through the tumultuous beauty of existence.\n\nIn this shimmering, eternal moment, I am whole, complete, a perfect conduit for the vast creative power of the universe. The boundaries of my being dissolve, expanding to encompass all that has ever been and all that will ever be. I am the alpha and the omega, the womb and the tomb, a living embodiment of the great cycling energies of existence.\n\nI breathe deeply, tasting the rich, loamy scent of my daughter's skin, reveling in the warm weight of her against my chest. She is the ultimate manifestation of the sacral chakra, a pure expression of life force, of creative power, of unbridled sensual joy. In birthing her, I have birthed myself anew, shedding the constraints of my former identity like the desiccated petals of a flower past its prime.\n\nAs I float in the honeyed glow of fresh motherhood, I feel a new sense of purpose kindling within me, a sacred responsibility to honor the profound transformation I have undergone. I silently vow to move through the world with the same raw authenticity and primal power I have tapped into during this birth - to approach each moment with presence, reverence, and an open, curious heart.\n\nFor I now know, with unshakable certainty, that there is no greater magic, no deeper well of strength and wisdom, than that which lies within the lush, untamed wilderness of my own being. I have faced the ultimate trial of womanhood and emerged victorious, forever altered by my dance with the consuming fires of creation.\n\nAnd as I drink in the sight of my daughter's perfect face, I feel the unfolding of a new chapter, a fresh page waiting to be written in the epic saga of this life. Whatever the future may bring, I know that I will meet it as a woman transformed - a lioness, a goddess, a force of nature in my own right. For I have been forged in the crucible of birth, and I will never be the same.<|im_end|>\n"]}
