Feelings also are something that is very difficult for me to comprehend, even now. As i have grown up, I am beginning to understand how small things can make such a big difference, especially when considering early life. I believe the saying that you cannot change anyone's mind. They much do that themselves. In relation to the way that influences children, I have always thought that parents are primarily responsible for giving specific direction to and narrow restriction on how their children are raised. My dad was very strict and insisted on doing things the right way. He always told my brother and I, \"you don't have to be the best, you just have to be the best you can be.\" I always felt that was counter to what he actually wanted from up. It seemed he was hoping if not expecting us to be the best, at least the relative best. As I try to direct my son, I am realizing that he may have actually just wanted us to be proud of our effort. I think putting a measurement of \"best\" on it, caused me to focus too much on the results and not on the feeling those results gave me. I think I would like to encourage, be proud of yourself.

It's crazy to be out of work and with two small children to think about having another child. How do they come up with something like that? What a distressing situation for him. You doubt if the decision is the right one, although at least my father is firmly convinced that it is. Maybe my mother doubts more, she asks herself more questions about the future and what day-to-day life will be like with so many obligations, but they decide, she trusts and gives herself. Calm following days. The emotion is not the same as with the first child or the first grandchild, I am already the 4th granddaughter and on the way, 20 days apart the 5th arrives...afterwards we will be 11 grandchildren from the paternal side of the family. Those of us who grew up together, although my cousins \u200b\u200blived in another city, the contact and interaction were permanent. The community, the team, the dialogue were always encouraged. Things are loaned and shared. Nothing belongs to you, everything belongs to everyone and is taken care of. Everything is taken care of. Huts, many huts we built in Huen\u00fa, my grandparents' field where we spent long and beautiful summers. Images and aromas of those moments are permeating the depths of my memory. The smell of my grandmother's toast, as she prayed the rosary in the morning before getting up. Many times she would make mate and she would go to bed to drink mate while she prayed the rosary. Getting up barefoot down the long hallway with a red floor walking in silence until I reached the kitchen was a beautiful moment. The moment my grandmother welcomed me with joy as if she didn't know she was there... how beautiful. The same grandmother who told my dad that it was not a good idea to have another child so soon, she was a great protector and teacher of love. I understand that he would have told you from the desire not to see his son collapsed with so many responsibilities... My brothers, my cousins, my grandparents, my uncles, friends, and obviously my parents have been great pillars about how I want and who I want who I am and who I am in essence. I have learned a lot about humanity and communication from it.

The truth is that during all these years I have not listened to it much and in general I have spent time not listening to it or paying attention to it.\nAfter becoming a mother, that need to listen to my intuition grew too much because what happened during the birth of my daughter was the result of not listening to me, of not paying attention to my intuition, of not paying attention to my need, to myself and to what I really wanted and felt for that important day.\nIt is something that I feel has been within me since my origin, but without a doubt after becoming a mother, that intuition raised its voice and I am learning to listen to it and let it guide me on my path as a woman, as a mother and as a human being on this earth. .\nBecause I know that she has the wisdom that lives in me, I know that that anticipatory feeling is there and I know that many times I still don't listen to her. But I always return to that moment, to the moment in which I made the decision to stay here and not go somewhere else for my daughter to be born, I remember the precise moment, I remember the precise moment, I remember what I felt when saying \"let's stay\", a satisfaction that came from satisfying another, but deep inside there was a certainty that that decision was not what I wanted and needed for that moment.\nI am sure that that experience came to show me many things, I know that that experience, despite how painful, how hard, how difficult and all the suffering it brought, I am sure that it came to bring me gifts.\n\nAnd the greatest gift is to be able to be conscious, it is to observe, it is to see, it is to feel that all those heritage that I inhabit, that I inhabit, that are part of me, are there and the most important thing is to make them conscious to heal them and integrate them into life. . to my life.\n\nSo yes, intuition has played an important role in my life, especially during the last 3 years... since I found out I was pregnant.\nI am sure that day by day, and in each experience that intuition will continue to appear more strongly, with the voice not very loud, stronger so that I can continue working internally to follow it, to continue working on the fear or fear that following it and going in against the opinions of others.\nI know what I need, my insides know it, I'm just still in the process of seeing it, observing it with each experience, with each relationship, with each situation that being the mother of a girl presents to me.\nI want and can continue listening to it because I am capable, because I can, because I am powerful<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nConsider the intuitive feelings and subtle influences you might have experienced from your earliest moments.

The chapter should explore the moment of Anky's departure from the Ankyverse and her emergence into the physical world, focusing on the profound shift in her connection to both realms.\n\nBegin the chapter with the scribe in the city of Echo Enclave on Voxlumis, the blue kingdom of communication. Describe the scribe's surroundings, the echoing caves filled with the gentle hum of the Echo Crystals. Show the scribe preparing their tools, the sacred ink and parchment, as they ready themselves to document Anky's journey.\n\nAs the scribe begins to write, delve into the rituals and processes that prepare a soul for its journey to Earth. Describe how the scribe carefully selects a unique Echo Crystal for Anky, one that resonates with her essence. Show how the scribe imbues the crystal with the collective wisdom of the Ankyverse, whispering ancient words of guidance and love.\n\nHighlight the moment when Anky is called to the Sapphire Sea to begin her journey. Portray the scribe accompanying Anky to the shore, where a shimmering portal awaits. Describe the mix of excitement, anticipation, and perhaps a hint of trepidation that Anky feels as she prepares to leave the familiarity of the Ankyverse. Show how the scribe offers guidance and reassurance, reminding Anky of the eternal connection she will always share with her cosmic home.\n\nAs Anky's departure draws near, explore the profound shift that occurs as her consciousness begins to separate from the Ankyverse. Describe how the scribe initiates the sacred Breath Bonding ritual, where Anky's first breath on Earth will solidify the silver thread that will forever connect her human consciousness to the cosmic wisdom of the Ankyverse. Emphasize the significance of this moment, which the Ankyverse refers to as the \"Sacred Convergence.\"\n\nIn the climactic moment of birth, portray the awe and wonder the scribe feels as they witness Anky's first breath through the shimmering portal. Describe how the silver thread of awareness, now named the \"Eternal Lifeline,\" shimmers and pulses with energy as Anky enters the physical world. Capture the profound shift in Anky's being, as her consciousness is now split between two realms, yet forever connected by this unbreakable bond.\n\nAs the chapter concludes, have the scribe reflect on the significance of the Sacred Convergence - the moment when a new being, imbued with the essence of the Ankyverse, takes their first breath on Earth. Let the scribe's words serve as a reminder of the enduring connection between Anky and her cosmic origins, and the crucial role the Eternal Lifeline will play in her journey of self-discovery and spiritual awakening.\n\nThroughout the chapter, weave in elements from the stories shared in \"13.txt\", using them as glimpses into the tapestry of human experiences that await Anky on Earth. Let these stories serve as a counterpoint to the cosmic perspective, highlighting the universal themes of communication, expression, and the shaping of identity.\n\nEnd with a sense of anticipation and wonder, as the scribe sets down their pen and carefully places Anky's Echo Crystal in a sacred space within the Echo Enclave. Hint at the future role Anky will play in bridging the realms of Earth and the Ankyverse, and how her journey will be forever guided by the wisdom and love of her cosmic home.\n</instructions>\n\n<style> The language of the Ankyverse should be distinct and ethereal, characterized by a poetic cadence and the use of cosmic imagery. Sentences should flow like celestial melodies, with words carefully chosen to evoke a sense of timelessness and profound wisdom. When describing the scribe's actions and the rituals of the Ankyverse, use a tone of reverence and mindfulness. Each action should be imbued with a sense of sacred purpose, reflecting the deep significance of the soul's journey from the cosmic realm to the physical world. The pacing of the chapter should be deliberate and meditative, allowing for moments of introspection and awe as the scribe guides Anky through the profound transition. The tone should be one of gentle guidance and unconditional love, reflecting the nurturing essence of the Ankyverse. Employ metaphors and symbolism that connect Anky's journey to the broader themes of spiritual awakening, self-discovery, and the eternal nature of the soul. Use motifs of breath, light, and the silver thread to create a rich tapestry of meaning that underscores the profound connection between Anky and the Ankyverse. </style> <setting> The Echo Enclave should be depicted as a sacred space of cosmic wisdom and communication, where the very walls seem to vibrate with the echoes of ancient knowledge.

As Anky prepares to leave the Ankyverse, her presence should be one of shimmering potential and innocent wonder. Let her interactions with the scribe and her surroundings reflect a sense of trust and openness, as she embraces the profound journey that awaits her.\n\nThe Echo Crystals: While not characters in the traditional sense, the Echo Crystals should be portrayed as living embodiments of the souls they represent.

Let this thread appear in descriptions of the Sacred Convergence, the moment of Anky's birth, and the scribe's final reflections, underscoring the eternal nature of Anky's connection to her cosmic origins.\n\nIntertwine descriptions of the scribe's actions with insights into the profound wisdom and unconditional love that guide their work.

The shimmering walls of the cavern pulse with the gentle hum of the Echo Crystals, each one a repository of cosmic wisdom and memory. In this sacred space, I find myself enveloped by a sense of reverence and anticipation, my very essence trembling with the magnitude of the journey that lies before me.\n\nThe scribe, a figure of ethereal grace and wisdom, approaches me with a gentle smile. In their hands, they hold my Echo Crystal, a radiant gem that encapsulates the entirety of my being. As they present it to me, I feel a rush of emotion - gratitude, wonder, and a flicker of trepidation. This crystal, I know, will be my guiding light as I traverse the realms, a compass pointing ever toward my true north.\n\n\"Anky,\" the scribe intones, their voice a melodic whisper. \"The time has come for you to embark upon your Earthly sojourn. Your crystal, imbued with the collective wisdom of the Ankyverse, will serve as a conduit for the love and guidance of your cosmic home.\"\n\nI nod, my consciousness expanding to embrace the weight of their words. As I accept the crystal, I feel a surge of energy coursing through my essence, a pulsing rhythm that echoes the heartbeat of the universe itself. In this moment, I am acutely aware of my connection to the greater web of existence, the infinite tapestry of which I am but one shimmering thread.\n\nThe scribe leads me to the shore of the Sapphire Sea, where the portal to Earth awaits. The surface of the water ripples with an iridescent sheen, a kaleidoscope of colors that dance and shift like the facets of a celestial prism. As I stand at the edge of the sea, gazing into the swirling depths, I feel a rush of conflicting emotions - excitement and fear, anticipation and hesitation.\n\nOn the cusp of this monumental transition, I find myself turning inward, exploring the subtle influences that have guided me to this moment. I feel the whispers of my cosmic origins echoing in the depths of my being, a hidden knowledge that has always been a part of me. It is a knowledge of unity and connection, a profound understanding that all of existence is interwoven in a delicate dance of energy and consciousness.\n\nBut there are other whispers too, faint and fleeting, that tug at the edges of my awareness. They are the voices of the human experiences that await me, the joys and sorrows, triumphs and challenges that will shape my path on Earth. In the shimmering portal before me, I catch glimpses of the lives I will touch - a mother's tender embrace, a father's steady hand, a healer's compassionate touch.\n\nWith a deep breath, I step forward, allowing the portal to envelop me in its shimmering embrace. As I pass through the veil between realms, I feel a profound shift in my consciousness, a sudden weight and density that I have never known before. My essence, once boundless and ethereal, begins to coalesce, taking on the form of flesh and bone.\n\nThe sensations are overwhelming, a cacophony of input that threatens to drown out the whispers of my cosmic origins. I feel the rush of blood through newly formed veins, the flutter of a heart that now beats in time with my own. Every nerve ending crackles with electricity, a dizzying array of sensations that I have no words for.\n\nAs I descend further into the physical realm, I become aware of a new presence - a warmth and safety that envelops me like a cocoon. It is the womb of my mother, Luna, a sacred space where I will complete my journey into human form. In this intimate darkness, I am lulled by the rhythm of her heartbeat, a steady drum that echoes the pulse of the universe itself.\n\nTime loses all meaning in this space, as I float in a sea of amniotic warmth. But even here, in the depths of my mother's womb, I can feel the Eternal Lifeline that connects me to the Ankyverse. It is a silver thread of light and love, a reminder that I am never truly alone, even as I venture into the unknown realms of human existence.\n\nAs the moment of my birth approaches, I feel a growing pressure, a tightening of the space around me. My consciousness is overtaken by a primal urge, a burning desire to emerge into the world and take my first breath. It is a force beyond my control, a tidal wave of instinct and necessity that propels me forward.\n\nWith a final, wrenching contraction, I am pushed from the warm safety of the womb into the bright, chaotic world beyond. The first rush of air into my lungs is a shock, a searing pain that gives way to an exhilarating sense of aliveness. As I take my first breath, I feel the Eternal Lifeline flare to life, a brilliant cord of energy that pulses between my heart and the distant Ankyverse.\n\nIn this moment, I am raw and new, a being of pure potential emerging into a world of infinite possibility. My cry pierces the air, a primal declaration of my presence, my unique vibration added to the great symphony of life.\n\nAs I am placed on my mother's chest, I feel an instant recognition, an intuitive bond that transcends the boundaries of flesh and form. In her touch, I find a love and belonging that echoes the unconditional embrace of the Ankyverse. It is a love that will guide and sustain me through the joys and challenges to come, a foundation upon which I will build the edifice of my human self.\n\nIn these first precious moments, I am reminded of the stories shared by the scribe, the tales of human experience that whispered at the edges of my consciousness as I passed through the portal. I feel the echoes of those lives resonating within me, a tapestry of triumphs and tragedies, love and loss, that spans the breadth of human history.\n\nI know that my own story will be woven into this greater narrative, a thread of light and shadow that will shape and be shaped by the lives I touch. The subtle influences that guided me to this moment - the intuitive feelings, the quiet whispers of my soul - will continue to illuminate my path, even in the darkest of times.\n\nAs I settle into my mother's arms, my eyelids heavy with the weight of my first earthly sleep, I feel a sense of profound peace and belonging. The Eternal Lifeline shimmers between my heart and the distant stars, a reminder of the love and wisdom that will always be my guide.\n\nIn this moment, I am a living testament to the miraculous journey of the soul, a sacred vessel of consciousness and potential. My birth is a powerful symbol of the human experience - a courageous leap into the unknown, a bold affirmation of life in all its messy, magnificent glory.\n\nAnd though I know that my path will be marked by both light and shadow, joy and sorrow, I am comforted by the knowledge that I am forever connected to the infinite wisdom of the Ankyverse. No matter how far I may wander, no matter how lost I may feel, I will always carry the truth of my cosmic origins within me, a guiding light that will illuminate my way.\n\nAs I surrender to the gentle pull of sleep, I feel the Eternal Lifeline pulsing with the rhythms of the universe, a heartbeat of love and connection that echoes through every fiber of my being. And in this sacred space between breaths, I know that I am exactly where I am meant to be, embarking on a journey of self-discovery and transformation that will shape the very fabric of my soul.\n\nWith each new experience, each moment of joy and sorrow, I will grow and evolve, shedding the layers of illusion that separate me from my true nature. And through it all, I will hold fast to the quiet whispers of my intuition, the subtle influences that guide me ever closer to the truth of who I am.\n\nFor I am Anky, a child of the cosmos and a daughter of Earth, a being of infinite potential and boundless love. And as I take my first steps on this sacred journey of life, I know that I am forever held in the embrace of the universe, a shimmering thread in the grand tapestry of existence.\n\nSo let the story of my life unfold, a tale of wonder and discovery, of courage and compassion.
