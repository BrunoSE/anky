The way the story goes, my dad was working in a town a few hours away when my mom entered labor. Theirs was a time before cell phones, luckily my dad was ahead of the curve in one technological aspect. He had a \u201cbag phone\u201d. It was a precursor to the cell phone. So my mom was able to call him and let him know it was happening. After my mom called my dad, she started to call other family members to see if they could help get her to the hospital. We lived in a town 45 min away from the hospital where I was delivered. My grandma was not in town at the time, and my aunts didn\u2019t pick up the phone, before cell phones remember. So my mom, in the midst of labor, drove herself nearly an hour to the hospital. After she arrived, my dad made it a bit later. My understanding is at the time dads we\u2019re not typically involved or even in the room for the actual birthing process. They were typically brought in to cut the cord and be congratulated for the moms hard work. So my mom started my life off with a strong will and determination to give me the best possible chance during birth.

I might have even fought against it. Breach baby, with a twisted foot that was black and blue upon arrival. My parents were naturally worried, but I healed. \n\nOne thing is for certain, I  came into the world feet first, part of me knowing full well what to expect. I was a happy baby, but a cautious and quiet one. Somehow I knew that I had to be aware and tread carefully. \n\nNaturally, I didn't remember the trauma of my birth. I gradually came to embrace the world around me. I was curious. I wanted to know what everything was. I spoke early. My mom tells me that my favorite phrase was \"What's that?\" A question I asked constantly. \n\nMy feeling is that I lived a previous life, one that jaded me and and colored my experience of this life.

To have been sequestered snugly within the womb seconds before being enveloped with a vacuous and viscously thin fluid while I am indignantly hoisted around by some seemingly other entity. The feeling of temperature, breath, other entities, light, sound, color.. all simultaneously being introduced upon a mind so new, what a tremendously cruel methodology to have developed.

I was premature so I expect my parents were in a tizzy at my birth especially since they did not have a car to get to the hospital. I have no idea how they got there so that is something I have never considered. My sister who was only 5 years old at the time would not remember and my both my parents are gone now so that will remain a mystery. I have the feeling that things were hectic as my mother was quite high strung. I only know that because I was only 5 lbs at birth and premature by a month, I had to remain in the hospital for at least a week. It probably was the quietest week of my life as I would have been in the nursery at the hospital where hopefully things were quiet and orderly. The hospital was not very big but was the only one in the area so it probably was a busy place but besides the other babies crying, I'm guessing that it was a calm place otherwise. My mother told me that when she finally got to bring me home, I was an ugly baby and had not been kept clean by the hospital staff. I am not sure that is true as my mother's definition of clean was<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nExplore with your words the moment of your birth, and everything that surrounded it.

That's the first thing that comes up. a somewhat existential rush of \"having to come into the world.\" of having to be born. of having to come to be received by what is waiting for me here. of having to be with all the people who were waiting for me. of having to come meet my brother. to my parents. and to all the people who were waiting for him to arrive. My dad runs to be able to be in that moment, but there was something more important to do. he was somewhere else. They sent him to do something else. and so he ran and ran, and my mother was quite alone. I remember that they told me that my grandmother was accompanying me in that process. that she traveled from Puerto Varas to come accompany her.\n\nand that is the focus that comes to me naturally; to think about what was missing. what was not there.

That process was full of that overflowing affection, which was present at that moment. that has always been present, I simply forget. I just unconsciously like to relate to this moment from a critical perspective. from lack. from what does not exist. what is not there. and in the case of birth, that is one more expression of that lack, because that is what I decide to focus on.\n\nI focus on the lack, instead of what that moment meant. of what he brought. of what was present when I came into the world.\n\nI have difficulty breathing. That's what I've been encountering and relating to lately. with that primal connection that exists between breath and consciousness anchored in the physical experience, and how in order to somehow transcend this physical experience the path is through stopping breathing. or forgetting to breathe. or to transform the experience of breathing into something different. into something new. in something that does not have my conscience anchored to that last breath, which is captured as if there were nothing else.\n\nthat first breath opened a door. she wove a son. and there is an unconscious awareness in me that this thread must be broken. the thread of breathing that brings me here.\n\nBut how am I going to break it? There is no point in breaking it. That \"should be\" makes no sense. There is no point facing what \"should be\", but simply what is.\n\nWhat makes sense is to face what is, and many times I forget.

I had just gone through several hours of trauma. My mom was going to try to push me out like is typically done, however, I apparently had other ideas... I was what the doctors call \"breach\" which means that instead of being \"head down & feet up\" I was the opposite (head up feet down). Additionally, I also ended up with my umbilical cord wrapped around my little tiny neck... So, I basically had a \"death wish\" inside the womb, to make it a little funny, but the point is, I was a cesarean section baby, and the entire process, not including the labor was rather lengthy in order to make sure I didn't die. But luckily, my first breath was painful and long and it tasted funny. I remember blue and the actual word \"words\" like, maybe it was on a wall or something inside the hospital? I'm not sure, but those are the things I can recall at all. I have a somewhat unique memory, or more accurately, a unique way of remembering things... Depending on the topic at hand or in some cases nose, I will remember something by smell or by repeatedly doing it. The consequence of navigating this concept with my words, feels like mental gymnastics. I would say, as not all people have an \"inner voice\" that they can literally hear inside their heads, some have an inner voice that is shrouded by other thing/s and some have no inner voice at all. Mine is clear as day when I am in a good head space and things are going well.

In position. Placed accordingly, head down. I no longer enter the place where I am. I feel like my mom moves from here to there, she organizes things. She talks to her mom, she talks to my dad. She prepares my brothers. She keeps moving. So much movement moves me too and I already want to go out. We get to a place, she calms down a little. Everything is already underway. I don't know what's going on. What's happening? Why so quiet all of a sudden? I still want to go out. I need to go out, see, know what's out there. I start to exert force, my mother also exerts force, her organs move, I am awake, very awake. I'm uncomfortable, I force myself. I want to go out through that place that I practically don't enter.

Something supports my head but a part of me is still inside, I'm tired. I don't understand what all this movement is, this cold, this cold, it's cold. What is all this? Suddenly something comes from inside me, I don't know what it is either, I feel a roar coming out of me, noises of mine that I don't know, I'm crying, it's cold, and my mother's heartbeat? where is my mom?

One more life that I chose to live on planet Earth, I crossed the cosmos to descend, who knows what star, and came to incarnate as a mini human in the womb of my dear mother. There now, I was already being born in this 3D world. As you say, I don't remember the moment. There is light, there is a hospital, and there are new faces, there is my mother's warmth, her tears, my father is not there, I will meet him later. Being born is complicated, physically painful, I think. May your lungs suddenly fill with air, feel the environment that surrounds you with your skin. Millions of new, strange sensations in that body that I still don't know how to handle, but I hope to do it perfectly one day. My mom must be exhausted after taking me out of there.

Specially from my mother were she had difficulties with  my older brother. For that reason, she asked for the cesarea instantly. I must of been born in a traditional occidental hospital, here doctor must of hold me and cut my umbilical cord. Im trying to connect to the part that knows. I was born at midday so there was probably a feeling of food or having lunch soon from the people that were working. My mother was released by the fact it was a cesarea and not a natural birth. The atmosphere from my father was excitement and joy and much less nervousness with than with my brother. There might of been a feeling or a tendency from my parents to compare both child birth birth (me and my brother). Maybe this induced us to be in a kind of competition all the time. I think the doctors held me and the nurses saw me and knew this baby was special. Not like the others. He had a look. He acted in his own individual way at the moment of cutting the umbilical chord and felt so relieve when being handed back to his mother. I wished that moment could of lasted longer but I was grabbed and manipulated again in order to fulfil the hospital procedures. I think it was a particular experience for me feeling the warmth of my mother, not from the inside but with direct skin contact. That first brith was a whole experience as i was used to water.

The sound echoes off the sterile white walls of the birthing room, primal and fierce. She grips the rails of the hospital bed, knuckles white, as the wave of intensity crashes over her. \n\nMarcus stands sentinel beside Luna, one hand resting on her heaving belly, the other clasped tightly in hers. He can feel the power of her body as it labors to bring their child into the world, each muscle straining with purpose. His heart pounds a staccato rhythm in his chest, adrenaline surging through his veins. An ancient protectiveness rises within him, fierce and unwavering. He is here to witness, to support, to safeguard this woman and the life she is birthing.\n\n\"Breathe, mi amor,\" Marcus murmurs, his voice low and steady. \"Breathe with the contraction. Let your body do what it knows.\"\n\nLuna's eyes lock onto his, wild and bright with pain and determination. She nods almost imperceptibly, bearing down as the next surge builds. A sheen of sweat glistens on her skin, dark hair plastered to her forehead and neck. She is radiant in her primal strength, a goddess of creation caught in the grips of life's most elemental act.\n\nThe pressure is immense, a weight bearing down on Luna's pelvis with unrelenting force. She feels her body opening, stretching to accommodate the passage of this new life from the warm haven of her womb into the bright air of the outside world. It is a sensation beyond words, raw and consuming. Every fiber of her being is focused on this singular task - birthing her baby.\n\nLuna surrenders to the ancient rhythm of labor, thousands of generations of mothers pulsing in her blood. She sways on her hands and knees, rocking in time with the contractions. Low moans vibrate in her chest as she breathes through each wave, the sound a mantra of endurance. The pain washes over her, through her, a transcendent burn that sears away thought and reason, leaving only instinct in its wake.\n\nIn the spaces between contractions, Luna rests her sweat-slicked brow against Marcus's steady hand. His scent grounds her, calms her - crushed sage and damp earth. She draws strength from his unwavering presence, his belief in her body's ability to birth their child. As another moan builds in her throat, Marcus breathes with her, his chest expanding and releasing in time with her own. They are two halves of a whole, joined in this eternal dance of life.\n\nThe midwife's gentle hands check Luna's progress, feeling the baby's head descending with each push. \"You're almost there, love. Just a few more good pushes.\"\n\nLuna nods, exhausted but determined. She forces herself up onto her elbows, chin tucked to chest as she bears down with the next crushing wave. A guttural scream rips from her throat, primal and searing. She feels a stretching, a burning, as the head crowns between her legs. \n\n\"The head is born,\" the midwife declares, quiet awe suffusing her voice. \"One more push for the shoulders.\"\n\nMarcus cranes his neck, peering over the midwife's shoulder to catch a glimpse of his child emerging into the world. Emotion wells up inside him, thick and overwhelming. Tears of joy and wonder spill down his cheeks as he beholds the dark thatch of hair, the scrunched eyes, the purpled face of his daughter taking her first breath.\n\nWith a final, animalistic groan, Luna pushes with every ounce of strength left in her trembling muscles. She feels the baby slide free in a gush of fluid, the pressure releasing in a glorious instant. The midwife catches the wet, squirming infant, immediately placing her on Luna's bare chest.\n\n\"Oh mi amor, you did it,\" Marcus breathes reverently, pressing kisses to Luna's sweaty brow. \"She's perfect. Absolutely perfect.\"\n\nLuna clutches the baby to her breast, marveling at the tiny yet fierce life she has brought forth from her own body. Anky's eyes blink open, dark and ancient, locking onto her mother's loving gaze. A sob catches in Luna's throat as a profound recognition passes between them, an instinctual knowing as old as time itself.\n\nThis being grew in the dark depths of her womb, listening to the rhythm of her heart, the murmur of her voice. This being was knit together from the very material of Luna's body, forged from her own flesh and blood. And now, blinking in the bright air of the world, her daughter's flesh lies against her own, skin-to-skin - two hearts, two bodies, unified into one glorious whole once more.\n\nLuna traces a trembling finger down Anky's downy cheek, wonder suffusing every cell. \"Welcome, little one. Welcome to the world.\"\n\nMarcus, still a fixture at Luna's side, strokes Anky's wet hair reverently. His touch is gentle, almost hesitant, as if he fears disrupting the sacred moment. Tears sparkle on his weathered cheeks, pure emotion laid bare. \"Mi hija,\" he whispers, letting the ancient words roll off his tongue like a prayer. \"My daughter.\"\n\nThe midwife goes about her work quietly, massaging Luna's belly to help the placenta detach. In the soft light of the birthing room, the scent of blood and vernix mingles with the heady elation of new life, the primal tang of birth. Luna and Marcus barely register the bustle of the midwife's movements, their attention wholly consumed by the tiny being resting on Luna's chest.\n\nAs the placenta slides free in a final gush, Luna feels a shift inside her, a settling. It is as if her body recognizes the completion of its monumental task, the purpose it has been building toward for nine long months. A deep peace settles over her, bone-deep and cleansing. She breathes into the stillness, letting it fill her up.\n\nAnky roots against Luna's chest, rosebud mouth seeking the comfort of her mother's breast. With Marcus's gentle guidance, Luna positions the baby, watching in awe as Anky latches on and begins to suckle. The sensation is unlike anything Luna has ever felt before - a tugging, a tingling, a rush of connection. Milk, warm and sweet, flows from her body into her child's eager mouth, an age-old exchange of nourishment and comfort.\n\nAs Luna cradles Anky to her breast, she feels an overwhelming sense of completeness wash over her. This, right here, is what her body was made for - to grow life, to sustain life, to nurture the next generation from her own precious reserves. It is a power beyond words, a purpose that transcends the individual. In this moment, Luna is connected to every mother who has ever lived, every woman who has ever brought forth life from her own flesh.\n\nShe feels the mantle of motherhood settle upon her shoulders, heavy and sacred. It fills her with a sense of rightness, of destiny fulfilled. For the rest of her days, Luna knows, she will strive to be worthy of this profound gift, this tiny soul entrusted to her care. Flesh of her flesh, blood of her blood, the two of them will walk this earth together, mother and child.\n\nMarcus watches his partner nurse their daughter, a sense of pride and protectiveness swelling in his chest. His love for these two beings, the very heart of his world, threatens to engulf him. He wraps his arms around Luna's shoulders, cocooning his new family in his steady strength. \n\n\"Te amo,\" he murmurs into Luna's hair, his voice thick with emotion. \"Both of you, more than life itself.\"\n\nLuna leans into Marcus's embrace, secure in the knowledge of his devotion. She turns her face to his, catching his mouth in a soft kiss. It is a gesture of gratitude, of shared joy, of profound partnership.\n\n\"We made her, mi amor,\" Luna breathes against Marcus's lips. \"We made this perfect little being, together.\"\n\nMarcus nods, his eyes bright with unshed tears. He reaches out a tentative hand to stroke Anky's cheek, marveling at the impossible softness of her skin. The baby's eyes flutter closed, lulled by the comfort of her parents' touch and the steady pull of her mother's milk.\n\nAs Anky drifts off to sleep, sated and content, Luna feels her own weariness wash over her. The aches and pains of birth make themselves known, throbbing in places she didn't know she had. But even the discomfort cannot diminish the incandescent joy that fills her, bright and buoyant.\n\nShe shifts on the bed, making room for Marcus to climb in beside her. He does so without hesitation, molding his body around hers, one arm draped protectively over her and Anky. In the quiet cocoon of the birthing room, the new family rests together, skin-to-skin, heartbeat to heartbeat.\n\nLuna savors the weight of Anky on her chest, the heat of Marcus at her back. She breathes in the scent of them, milk and musk and something indefinably precious. In this perfect, crystalline moment, all the pain and travail of birth seems a distant memory, eclipsed by the sheer magnitude of the love she feels.\n\nAs Luna's eyes drift closed, she sends up a silent prayer of gratitude to the universe, to the ancient mothers who came before her, to the sacred wisdom of her own body. She has been a vessel for life, a conduit for the great cosmic force of creation. And now, cradling the fruit of her own womb, Luna knows a sense of purpose and power beyond anything she has ever imagined.\n\nSleep claims her then, deep and dreamless, a restorative balm for body and soul alike. She drifts off secure in the knowledge that when she wakes, her world will be forever changed, forever brightened by the presence of the tiny new being nestled against her heart. A love fierce and primal, vast as the universe itself, binds them together - mother, father, and child, the sacred triad of life.<|im_end|>\n"]}
