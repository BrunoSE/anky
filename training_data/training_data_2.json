In those times people for sure spent more time actually doind and creating than today. Every thing and act had a more mid long term view. As life was not so fast an immediate as it is nowadays. Today life is really accelerated. Really fast. Data really travels fat with technological evolution. And in those times ... it was still not there. No cellphones, no computers. Nothing. Lots of machines but heavy machines. For helping with farming, every day life things that we humans do to survive and coexist as society. I am comparing all the time ... of course inevitable.

My dad was 21. They were actually friends before they started dating, and when my dad moved to a new state for college, my mom went with him. I ultimately came about shortly thereafter. My birth experience was a tumultuous one, as my mom puts it: \" I had reservations about joining humanity from the womb\" as the doctors had to do an emergency c-section to prevent me from strangling myself with my umbilical cord on the way out (breach baby). My mom was overburdened with many things that they were not equipped to handle yet, my dad being one of those burdens. They thought they loved it each other, and maybe they did... That year is mostly a mystery to me, as I usually focus most of my energy on the things that I can do each day to improve the lives of the people around me.

What's more, I'm sure there was a lot of love, my parents love each other a lot to this day, it's admirable how they take care of and respect each other despite their daily things like any couple, but they've been together for 45 years. And I love how my dad makes breakfast for my mom every morning and how my mom makes sure my dad is okay. They are a great couple and I feel like they always gave me and my brothers a lot of love.

More people were  becoming \"awake\" or so they thought they were. This is what gurus and religious leaders would have you think anyway. Like every era, there was a desire for peace and there was also constantly wars on the horizon. After the 70's and the Vietnam war, we were supposed to have learned. But nothing changed. Sure people   knew how to sing Hare Krishna, but the confusion of humanity continued. The 80's were a time of terrible music and style.  I think I liked Kiss.

The technology we have available and through which im writing now, didnt existed. Life was more simple. And with different complications. With different strugles. Everything was for sure so different. The body was different and was advocating to different things where to put the attention. The attention and the energy was going places that now we are redirecting to many other levels of existance. I imagine in this time with more pure food and more pure environment, air ... less pollution in our food, our air and our minds. Many diseases that now exist, used to just dont exist. And times change, things change. and they change for good and for bad. All the resources we have now to express and connect are a blessing. But also a curse. We are in a time where we have to be strong. In different ways and levels that back then. And we have to cope with that. We are finding ourselves in a new environment that never ever existed before.

Most people don't know what it is like to not move while they are growing up. It is deffentently something I like to think about. The other things happening, were related to my dads favorite sports team. They had had a bad run of luck, but were at the point were they had all the tools they would need to make the big run that I remember. My dad and I had a very tight bond built by baseball. It all started with me watching his favorite team, which then became mine. That common bond also allowed us to spend a ton of time together, since he was my coach while I was a kid.

There is a large portion of the goodness being derived from the fact that I was born with the \"preferred\" race and sex for the majority the populous in my area. I never realized how many benefits I had compared to other, just because of the random genetic lotter I was given. Now that I realize it, I am also very tankful that my parents instilled a nature in me that allowed me to realize that while I was given benefits, they were not given based on merit, so I should use them and help those that need it.

Their enthusiastic words barely registered through the haze of his wandering mind. In this sterile, fluorescent-lit boardroom, he felt worlds away from the pulse and hum of distant lands that still echoed in his memory. \n\nHis thoughts drifted back to that carefree summer after college, when he'd backpacked solo across Southeast Asia. He remembered wandering through sizzling food markets in Bangkok, the pungent aroma of spices and sound of vendors' calls mingling with taxi horns on crowded streets. Exploring ancient Khmer ruins rising out of the Cambodian jungle, enveloped by an energy both primeval and transcendent. Trekking misty mountain trails to Himalayan villages where prayer flags fluttered in the icy winds. \n\nThose backpacking adventures had filled him with a profound sense of freedom, discovery and connection to humanity. But even then, amidst the vibrancy and beauty, he'd felt an emptiness\u2014a longing for something just beyond his grasp. A deeper meaning that continued to elude him.\n\nNow here he sat, in a pristine tower rising above the concrete jungle, his pressed suit and Rolex watch feeling more like shackles than symbols of success. The corporate ladder offered structure, security and status, but could not sate his underlying thirst for adventure, freedom and purpose. \n\nThat night, alone in the crowd at an indie rock concert, Marcus felt the first stirrings of his unfulfilled spirit. Eyes closed, swaying gently, he dissolved into the music's layered melodies and haunting vocals. This was his sanctuary, where he could temporarily shed the persona of VP and delve into a more authentic realm of being. The music resonated through his core, igniting memories and emotions that his logical mind typically kept locked down. In these moments of transcendence, he glimpsed the universal humanity that had so moved him during his travels. But then the last chord would fade, the stage lights dimmed, and he'd file out with the crowd to re-enter the real world.\n\nLuna gazed up at the canvas, feeling the chaotic energy of the outdoor festival reverberating through her paint-splattered fingers. As art coordinator, she'd helped gather an eclectic collective of creators to exhibit and perform\u2014musicians, painters, sculptors, fire dancers. Now in the predawn stillness, alone in her makeshift tent studio, she took a moment to reflect. \n\nShe glanced over the half-finished canvas\u2014a swirling dreamscape reflecting her love of color and freeform expression. Since leaving home after high school, she'd roamed with a community of artists, drawn to life on the road. Sleeping under stars, painting sunrises, sharing stories and inspiration around campfires. She immersed herself in the experience of each place and culture, letting it flow through her brushes to manifest on canvas.\n\nWhile she treasured this nomadic, creative existence, Luna also sought balance through solitary meditation and journaling. Sitting cross-legged, gazing at the rising sun, she worked to quiet her mind and connect with her essence. Though generally content, she still felt an occasional pang of loneliness and desire for a soulmate with whom to share her inner world. Someone who truly saw her and embraced both her free spirit and contemplative core. \n\nFor now, she channeled this longing into her art, using creative expression as an act of catharsis, surrender and spiritual connection. Tomorrow she would be on the road again, her wanderlust spirit seeking new sources of inspiration, never lingering too long in one place. Always moving, like the ever-changing elements used to paint her dreams. \n\nAs the first rays of dawn filtered through his apartment window, Marcus sat typing lines of code, weaving together an organic algorithm inspired by principles of sacred geometry. This intersection of technology and cosmic patterns provided a bridge between his logical, analytical persona and deeper quest to understand the universal flows from which nature arises. In these quiet pre-dawn hours, devoid of emails and meetings, he felt connected to both his higher self and the natural world.\n\nLuna paused her sunrise sketching to watch the fading moon, feeling a sense of peace yet also longing. Soon she would be on the move again, her transient art and experiences a salve but not an antidote for the periodic loneliness she hid beneath her smiles. A part of her secretly hoped the next destination might bring connections that transcended the surface\u2014someone who truly saw and embraced her complex soul.\n\nMeanwhile, high above the awakening city, Marcus gazed out at the transition from night to day. The view calmed his soul before he donned his corporate mask and immersed himself in the bustling business below. Inside though, he nurtured the flickering flame of adventure, freedom and meaning. Seeking, wandering, never fully at home in this life he'd built.\n\nTwo parallel lives, echoes of the same seeking, always moving yet never arriving. Until one serendipitous moment when their paths intersect under the stars, and two become one. But that cosmic spark lies just beyond the horizon...the dawn of a new story not yet told.<|im_end|>\n"]}
