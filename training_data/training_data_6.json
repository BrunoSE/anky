What did they care about? How do you think these influenced your early perceptions and understanding?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI don't know if they had much hope or vision for the future. I have always seen them as quite superficial people, who care a lot about what people think of them, and what they think of people. always thinking about what people do, and doing things in relation to what those things are going to have as a consequence in the eyes of the people around them. That's what I always see them doing, and I imagine it was similar at that time.\n\nmy mother, the popular girl from Puerto Varas, and that everyone was chasing her. my dad, the successful banker of a thousand friends, always worried about everyone, always greeting everyone, calling everyone on his birthday, etc.\n\nThat's what it always seemed to me that they brought, and what they encountered. I have never seen them with much hope for the future. Well, what they say is typical... that our children are happy, and that they develop fully. but that is something that often comes from the perspective of the ego. of an egoic structure that seeks to strengthen itself from the perception that the world and the rest have of it, and in the case of my parents I believe that this is very preponderant.\n\nI don't know if they had a very great capacity to have a perspective of the world that was consolidated, strong. I feel that many times it is governed by how the world shaped them, and without much decision-making power as to how they construct that.\n\nI don't know, that's what comes to mind as an idea. as an excuse. as a way of relating to this process of my mother. I can't imagine them sitting together discussing the dreams they had together. Those dreams have always been pretty superficial, and that's what brings this question into perspective for me. I don't know what the truth mattered to them.\n\nto my dad: work, be able to provide for the family, and climb the ladder of power in a very hierarchical place like a bank. My dad always, his entire life, worked in banks, and this is one of the most hierarchical and structured structures. My dad was always very structured, and his focus was always there. giving the family what he could, what he had left. also going to the stadium. sharing in the stadium, and watching his (Catholic) soccer team there.\n\nIn my mom's case, I don't know what was worrying her. She was newly arrived in Santiago, and she didn't have much to anchor her to life. or a lot of emotion. I don't know.\n\nI imagine that this influences my life because there is no specific thing in me that makes me feel \"that's what I love.\" \"That is the most important\".\n\nthere is a lack of clarity.<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nDuring your time in the womb, what hopes and views did your parents have about the world and your future? What did they care about? How do you think these influenced your early perceptions and understanding?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nMy early years were surely effected by a rural Mennonite upbringing. The first home that I knew had a large pasture and hill. I don't remember any winters, only the summers there. Most of my early memories are a blur, things that I can only seem to pull out when something demands that of  me, but if I just try to think about when I was very young, nothing seems to come out. I remember being in the living room after a fight with my brother, my mother putting butter on my black eye. I remember having a bull that lived in the pasture. I remember climbing a tree next to the garage. My father has always been a somewhat pessimistic person, always saying how things are getting worse, because often they are, and how that relates to what the Bible says. My mother is... in kind terms, simple. She isn't stupid, but I feel that she intentionally ignores the world because she isn't interested in anything past what she is living, and this likely comes from her Amish upbringing.<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nDuring your time in the womb, what hopes and views did your parents have about the world and your future? What did they care about? How do you think these influenced your early perceptions and understanding?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI guess they were looking for stability, it was a young country that got separated from Russia after soviet union fell, I think there was a push for freedom, imaginations about that - which occupies most of my thinking today. So the things they cared about were all the basics you'd look at when you're establishing your own country and nation: set it up in a way to let people do their thing, invest into sports etc. to be presented and do well in global olympic games etc. Even though I can't go more into these details for obvious reasons, I think those influenced me and my life greatly, I've got a sister and a brother and both of them barely left the country and are chained in those borders while I'm living for over 5 years soon, abroad and can't come back there, because I value my freedom really, really high and wouldn't change it for anything. This given me opportunity to meet my family abroad and spend some great time together. That may have also influenced my way thinking, asking to get to the bottom of things and make sure everything makes sense or move away from it. My parents quit all alcohol also and cigarrettes while I was in, which may helped it even further. If I were born in a different time, it may have not worked out as it did. And it sets me up on a more mindful journey going forward. These may have had a direct influence on my early and later perceptions on the world but as for understanding you have to take your time to get through every point and discover new points to make sense of, to make a semithe image of the world<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nDuring your time in the womb, what hopes and views did your parents have about the world and your future? What did they care about? How do you think these influenced your early perceptions and understanding?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nPhew, good question. I really have not much idea. But I can imagine a little bit. If I can imagine a little... I don't have much idea about what mattered to them at that time... Well now that I start writing I get information. My mom was working with clothes, modeling... and in fact when I was very, very little I participated in modeling, for magazines... but anyway... my parents always wanted to have children. and my mother had several losses. So one of the greatest desires of both of us was in fact to have me. It was a very difficult topic to specify and it finally became concrete with my birth. Which was quite difficult. But I'm sure they gave the best they could at this time based on the understanding that they had at that time that it was best for me and them at that time.\nMy father full working. Long days. His mission was always to provide economic energy in the family so that my mother could focus on pregnancy and motherhood. So it was. I always remember that I saw little of my dad. At the end of the days and on weekends of course... but not much during the week. He worked a lot. A little too much. And well, there was his greatest interest... Being able to provide. And that everyone was calm. That my mother could be as calm as possible in this process. A very powerful process and also full of fear for those lost pasts.\nI imagine that if you want to be a father/mother and you can't, it must be very frustrating and then with each pregnancy a great fear arises because of that past trauma. So during my pregnancy, that was present for sure. But we all did it... And here I am... writing. Thanks to that process... which was with fear but also a lot, a lot of love. I am very grateful for the fact that there are many things that are difficult for me to accept about my parents, that they have always done the best they could. always. That gives me peace of mind and also frees them inside me from what is sometimes like \"how did they do this this way or that way\" sometimes there are things that are difficult to accept. But when you understand that we are all doing the best we can with the tools and understanding we have of life... Everything calms down a little more inside. Because that is the truth and reality. We are all trying our best... Giving our best. And come on<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nDuring your time in the womb, what hopes and views did your parents have about the world and your future? What did they care about? How do you think these influenced your early perceptions and understanding?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nWhile I was in my mother's womb, I am not very clear what her hopes were. The truth is that I have never talked to her or my dad about this. Sometimes I think and feel that we are missing many conversations and talking about things as they are, answering uncomfortable questions and facing issues that are very hidden.\nIt is unfortunate that in many families there are secrets and hidden things, finally I feel and believe that keeping these things hidden does not allow us to access or get closer to healing and to detach ourselves from old unconscious patterns that we have and that we carry when being part of humanity and coming from another human.\nI think and feel that in relation to my mother, she was very young when she got married and when she became pregnant with me, I think she was not very clear about what to do or where to go, I think she got married to get out of her house and my grandfather's claws.\nI think she always wanted to be a mother and she always really liked children. I think the hope was to form a large family and experience life from there. I feel that this pleasure and pleasure in motherhood is something that I also carry, in addition to having been the older sister of 6, I always had to carry out the role of mother, caregiver and supporter even in moments when it was not my place to do so. Regarding my first perceptions and understanding, I don't know how to answer the truth, since I don't have memories but I do have some images that marked my childhood about my mother crying in the bathroom locked up with me and my father knocking on the door outside.\nI think they didn't get along well and my mother was very little, she had always lived under a strict and violent doctrine from my grandfather.\nIn addition to being born in a time when doctors, pediatricians and \"specialists\" had more wisdom than her own mother, my mother followed advice and recommendations from them, advice and recommendations that today are absolutely obsolete and that in fact are considered violent. and not recommended for the development of the bond between a mother and her newborn baby.\nBefore, the recommendation was to feed every certain number of hours, not to hold the baby in your arms because she got used to it, not to sleep with the baby and an endless number of things that today I consider terrible. and I would never do it with my little mila,<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nDuring your time in the womb, what hopes and views did your parents have about the world and your future?

The reason was me. Because he clearly didn't want to jeopardize my future. Betting on something irrational could keep him away from me and my mother for a long time and perhaps forever.

A coffee date... a walk along the river and attending the opera. This new world gave them freedom and that is what they wanted for us as a family. This influenced me a lot. Being born in another country, in a European country, changes you. I understood another language, other customs... Chile for me in images was a building on fire.\nMy parents' vision of the world led to me not having my ears pierced or being baptized. Freedom to choose! And to choose when I had the criteria formed.<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nDuring your time in the womb, what hopes and views did your parents have about the world and your future? What did they care about? How do you think these influenced your early perceptions and understanding?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDuring my time in the womb, my parents were very different people from who they are at this moment. As of right now they are very compassionate and have weathered the \"storm that is life\" with pride and have endured to be honest, in some ways many things that I may not have been able to endure. Thankful, would be how I describe my perception of their shortcomings, because without them, they would not be the people that they are. The bottom line is, my parents were, in my opinion, very not ready to be with other people. My Dad during my moms pregnancy was there for her \"to the best of his ability\" which in all reality, even by todays \"generally speaking\" cis-hetero sexual relationship, he would still be considered a gentleman. As he was a genuine role model of what a man should be. In retrospect, I had preconceived notions that impacted my ability to without any bias, understand what was happening and of course that's the case I was in the womb. But the point is, people should try to learn to love themselves, before they start trying to learn how to love other people; and you can't love somebody that you don't know enough about. My parents loved the idea of each other enough to make me and of that I am sure.\nThe impact that this has/had on my early perceptions and understanding, is that my parents had other things to do. My feelings were not their top priority, and I rarely had time to see them as they were either working or apart and I cannot recall much of their appearance from when I was a child. Most of the memories I have put me into the shoes of myself as a young man and not a small child.

How do you think these influenced your early perceptions and understanding?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI think that above all, my parents cared that the family was well, that is, us, I mean my sister and me. I think that in their lives there was uncertainty about the future and a new adventure that was beginning. They were assigned, for my father's work, to a faraway country to be there for 5 years. I think that may have influenced my concept of family, of caring for the flock, of ensuring that harmony lasts. It was important to stay united, to take care of that family unit in that far from distant future that was coming to them. Moving to a distant country, Sweden, with another language, without knowing anyone, far from your family, your comfort zone, must be complex. Nothing easy, many questions and open fronts. Will we adapt? Will the girls be okay? What will our house, our environment be like? I think that all the trips that came after that, all the future destinations that were tracing my dad's career path, marked that path of opening the mind, opening the heart, and being super adaptable. Meeting new people, different cultures always opens your mind in my opinion, you learn to be tolerant that we are not all the same, and that everything will be fine. You start to trust in yourself, that in the end you will be okay, wherever you are. I think that marked our family's life a lot and it was important for my parents to keep that core strong and contain us as best they could and that our grumpy teenagers would allow them once that time came. The family nucleus, strong, united, that was the idea, although it did not always turn out that way. But I think that is natural and normal in the growth of any being, it seeks its independence, its personality, it falls under influence, it does not know well<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nDuring your time in the womb, what hopes and views did your parents have about the world and your future?

How do you think these influenced your early perceptions and understanding?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI think there was an atmosphere of hope, given that just that year we were experiencing the return of democracy in Chile.\nI'm sure my parents disagreed on many political issues and visions about the future. They were both quite opposites. By observing them I understood the idea of \u200b\u200bthe \u201ccomplement\u201d because they were not alike in so many ways, and in some cases their values \u200b\u200bwere placed in different places.\nI think that perspective of differences and 'letting others be' are the first perceptions that I was able to absorb. In my family differences were respected.,\nI can't remember exactly what mattered to them, but I think the community usually aims to think about the future, prosperity, the desire for things to turn out well... maybe hope?\nThe hope that the world that awaited us (their children) is a better place than the one they know\u2026. My artist parents, always understanding sensitivity as a fundamental axis for a better society...\nWhy the sensitivity? Because it represents the multiple possibilities that life touches you. Becoming sensitive means that what surrounds us modifies our experience, involves us in reality, and makes reality part of us. Many times we are not aware of it, and we suffer. But it is a great gift, I have learned it over time.\nI am sure that this totally influences my current perception of the world, since when I analyze it through this exercise, I realize that it has been a foundation that has evolved throughout my entire life, because my parents brought it with them. during yours. It is a kind of science, an inheritance of something that is developed and discovered through individual experience, but collective at the same time. We sit on an idea, which touched another as well, and we collect from the life of this other human being, fertilizer for our own, co-creating together, without many times realizing, that we are a single human experience, inherited from the same nature. and the cosmos.\n            .<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nDuring your time in the womb, what hopes and views did your parents have about the world and your future?

We would go on the big holidays with my grandparents but not with any regular occasion. Those trips to church on Christmas Eve with the whole extended family is one of the memories I find myself reflecting upon. Later as a teenager I ended up becoming religious. However, after moving to university I fell away from it. Reflecting I think that I was most likely going for the friend group not to say that I didn\u2019t experience extreme emotions during my time with the group. Now I would probably point out the many many years of experience religious organizations have at influencing those types of emotions on people, especially those of a younger age. Now I believe that organized religion is false but don\u2019t pretend to think I know enough for a definitive answer if there is a singular intelligence that created what we observe as reality. To me religion is too well suited for controlling a population to be anything but man made. I do believe in spirituality.

Luna\u2019s father, a man of resilience and rich cultural background, brings stories and wisdom from the past.

The scent of roasted butternut squash soup and freshly baked bread wafted from the kitchen, mingling with the crisp aroma of fallen leaves that drifted in on a gentle breeze. As she folded linen napkins into neat triangles, Luna paused, her hand resting lightly on the swell of her belly. A tiny flutter of movement quickened beneath her fingers and she smiled, marveling silently at the life growing inside her.\n\nMarcus emerged from the kitchen, his brow furrowed in concentration as he carried a heavy cast iron pot to the table. Setting it down on a woven trivet, he glanced up, catching Luna's eye. \"Almost ready,\" he said, his voice tinged with an uncharacteristic note of anxiety. \"I just need to slice the bread and we should be all set.\" \n\nLuna nodded, reaching out to give his arm a reassuring squeeze. \"It's going to be fine,\" she said softly. \"They're going to be thrilled.\" \n\nBut even as the words left her lips, a flicker of uncertainty passed through her. Since the moment they had discovered her pregnancy, Luna and Marcus had been grappling with the complexity of emotions that came with impending parenthood. For Luna, the absence of her mother weighed heavily, a bittersweet ache that pulsed just beneath the joy and anticipation. She longed to share this moment with the woman who had shaped her, to seek her guidance and wisdom as she navigated this new path.\n\nAs if sensing her thoughts, Marcus paused, his hand resting gently on the small of her back. \"She would be so proud of you,\" he murmured, his voice low and tender. \"I wish she could be here to see the incredible mother you're going to be.\"\n\nLuna leaned into his touch, drawing strength from his steadiness. \"I know,\" she whispered, blinking back the sudden sting of tears. \"But in a way, she is here. In every story my father tells, in every lesson she taught me. She's a part of me, and she always will be.\"\n\nMarcus nodded, his eyes shining with a mixture of love and understanding. He knew the weight of legacy, the way the past shaped the present and molded the future. In the warmth of their home, surrounded by the artifacts of their shared life, he couldn't help but reflect on his own upbringing, the values and aspirations his parents had instilled in him. \n\nA knock at the door jolted them from their reverie, and Luna smoothed her hands nervously over her dress as Marcus went to greet their parents. As the door swung open, a rush of cool air swept in, carrying with it the voices of their loved ones.\n\nLuna's father entered first, his weathered face breaking into a wide smile as he enveloped his daughter in a warm embrace. \"Mi luna,\" he murmured, holding her close. \"You look radiant.\"\n\nAs they separated, Luna saw the glimmer of unshed tears in his eyes, a reflection of the bitter and the sweet that colored this moment. Her father had been her rock in the years since her mother's passing, a constant source of love and support. But she knew that her pregnancy stirred up a well of emotions within him, memories of his own journey into parenthood and the partner he had shared it with.\n\nMarcus's parents followed close behind, their faces alight with the excitement of the gathering. As greetings and embraces were exchanged, the atmosphere shifted, the room filling with the warmth of connection and the unspoken understanding that this moment held a special significance.\n\nAs they settled around the table, the conversation flowed easily, laughter punctuating stories and memories. Luna watched as her father's eyes grew distant, a wistful smile playing at the corners of his mouth as he spoke of her mother.\n\n\"She was always so fearless,\" he said, his voice thick with emotion. \"When we first came to this country, everything was new and strange, but your mother... she embraced it all. The language, the customs, the food.\" He chuckled softly, shaking his head. \"I remember the first time she tried to make a Thanksgiving turkey. It was a disaster, but she just laughed and said, 'Well, I guess we're having enchiladas instead.'\"\n\nLuna felt a swell of pride and longing rise within her, a fierce ache for the woman she had lost and the strength she had embodied. \"I wish I had her courage,\" she said softly, her hand drifting unconsciously to her belly. \"To face the unknown with such grace and humor.\"\n\nHer father reached across the table, covering her hand with his own. \"You do, mija,\" he said firmly. \"It's in your blood, in the way you move through the world. Your mother's spirit lives on in you, and it will guide you as you become a mother yourself.\"\n\nAcross the table, Marcus's parents exchanged a glance, a silent conversation passing between them. \"We never had the courage to uproot ourselves like that,\" his mother said, her voice tinged with a hint of regret. \"We always played it safe, sought stability above all else.\"\n\nMarcus's father nodded, his brow furrowed in thought. \"It's what we thought was best at the time,\" he said slowly. \"To build a solid foundation, to give our children a sense of security.\" He looked up, meeting Marcus's gaze. \"But watching you and Luna, seeing the way you embrace change and growth... it makes me wonder if we missed out on something.\"\n\nMarcus felt a sudden rush of understanding, a clarity that had eluded him in the past. His parents had given him roots, a sense of groundedness that had allowed him to weather life's storms. But it was Luna who had taught him to soar, to embrace the unknown with an open heart and a curious mind.\n\nAs the meal drew to a close, Luna and Marcus exchanged a glance, a flutter of nervous anticipation passing between them. Luna took a deep breath, her heart pounding in her chest as she rose from her seat.\n\n\"There's something we want to share with you,\" she said, her voice trembling slightly. \"Something that we've been holding close to our hearts these past few months.\"\n\nShe looked to Marcus, drawing strength from the love and certainty she saw reflected in his eyes. \"We're pregnant,\" she said softly, a radiant smile breaking across her face. \"We're going to have a baby.\"\n\nFor a moment, the room was silent, a breathless pause as the news settled over the gathering. And then, like a dam breaking, the tears and laughter and embraces flowed freely, a tidal wave of joy and love and celebration.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos, Luna found herself wrapped in her father's arms, his tears mingling with her own. \"Your mother would be so proud,\" he whispered fiercely. \"So proud of the woman you've become and the mother you will be.\"\n\nAcross the room, Marcus stood with his parents, their faces alight with wonder and awe. \"A grandchild,\" his mother breathed, her hand fluttering to her heart. \"I never thought I'd see the day.\"\n\nHis father clapped him on the back, his eyes shining with emotion. \"You're going to be an incredible father,\" he said gruffly. \"Just like your grandfather was to me.\"\n\nAs the initial shock and elation settled into a warm glow of contentment, the conversation took on a new depth, a reflection on the legacies that had brought them to this moment and the hopes they held for the future.\n\n\"You know,\" Luna's father said thoughtfully, \"when your mother and I first found out we were expecting you, we were terrified. We had just moved to a new country, everything was uncertain. But your mother... she just had this unshakable faith that everything would work out as it was meant to.\"\n\nHe smiled, his gaze distant with memory. \"She used to say that life was like a dance. You might not know the steps, but if you trust your partner and let the music guide you, you'll always find your way.\"\n\nMarcus felt a sudden surge of emotion, a realization of the profound wisdom in those words. He looked at Luna, saw the way her eyes shone with love and determination, and knew that together, they would find their way.\n\nAs the afternoon stretched into evening, the gathering took on a sense of timelessness, a feeling of connection that transcended the boundaries of past and present. Stories were shared, laughter echoed through the room, and slowly, the shape of a new legacy began to take form.\n\nFor Luna and Marcus, the revelations of the day brought a newfound clarity, a deeper understanding of the contrasts and the commonalities that had shaped their families' histories. They saw the strength and resilience that had been passed down through generations, the way love and connection had sustained their ancestors through times of upheaval and change.\n\nAnd as they looked to the future, to the child that would soon be born into their lives, they knew that they would draw on that strength, that they would build a home that honored the past while embracing the possibilities of the future.\n\nAs the last rays of the autumn sun dipped below the horizon, casting the room in a warm, golden glow, Luna and Marcus bid their parents farewell, their hearts full of gratitude and love. They stood together in the doorway, watching as the taillights of their parents' cars disappeared into the gathering dusk.\n\nIn the stillness that followed, Luna turned to Marcus, her hand finding his in the half-light. \"Thank you,\" she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. \"For being my partner in this dance.\"\n\nMarcus drew her close, pressing a soft kiss to her forehead. \"Always,\" he murmured, his voice a promise and a prayer. \"No matter where the music takes us, we'll find our way together.\"\n\nAnd as they stepped back into the warmth of their home, surrounded by the love and wisdom of their families, Luna and Marcus knew that they were ready for the journey ahead, ready to embrace the joys and the challenges of parenthood with open hearts and a deep, abiding faith in the power of love to guide them through.\n\nMonths later, in a sun-dappled hospital room, Luna would cradle her newborn son in her arms, marveling at the perfect curve of his cheek and the impossibly tiny fingers that curled around her own. And in that moment, as Marcus looked on with tears of joy and wonder in his eyes, they would feel the weight of the generations stretching out behind them, the legacies of love and strength that had brought them to this sacred threshold.\n\nThey would whisper their hopes and dreams to their sleeping child, promises of a life rich with meaning and purpose, a life rooted in the love and wisdom of all those who had come before. They would speak of the way their souls had connected across time and space, drawn together by an invisible thread that transcended time.\n\nAnd when I would enter the room, my notepad clasped tightly to my chest, ready to help them record these first precious moments of parenthood in a letter to their son, they would smile, seeing all the seeds of care and devotion already sprouting within me too.\n\nAs I would put pen to paper, my mind and heart would be filled not just with their words but with the power of the stories and reckonings that had passed between Luna, Marcus and their parents on that golden autumn day. The day when two families' legacies had blended into one, when the contrasts and complementarities of their histories had clicked into place so the future could take flight.\n\nAnd I would sigh, knowing I had a long way to go to do justice to it all, to paint the fullness and beauty of what connects us across the ages and what is born anew with every child. But I would begin, one word at a time, one story and one life at a time \u2013 for what else can any of us do? What else will carry us forward, if not this insistence on weaving meaning and memory into the warp and weft of our shared existence, come what may?\n\nSo I would write, and Luna would nurse her son as Marcus stroked the downy fuzz on his tiny head, and the ghosts and guardians of generations past would hover around us, blessing the work of living and loving. Smiling as the dance goes on, the dance no one knows the steps to but everyone, somehow, somewhere deep inside, remembers.\n\n<|im_end|>\n"]}
