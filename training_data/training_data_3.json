It was a hot summer day. My parents where probably with other friends at a gathering or simply enjoying the summer holidays somewhere in the world. I love the weather and freedom from this month. I associate southern hemisphere summer with being outside, the beach, lots of activities, friends gathered together. This energy, at the same time can bring down effects if not handled properly. For example, I remember as negative feelings of this season, the social anxiety of missing out or not being ready with a plan to enjoy. Always trying to be part of something and trying to be where the sun shines at its brightest (in a metaphorical way), this means looking for the hype or the cool things. Nevertheless, Summer has always given me nice stories to share, lots of growth and being outside of the comfort zone. I love enjoying the sun, beach, waves. In this season Ive met many new friends, got into problems which then became stories to share and the connection with water was always present.<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nTravel back nine months before you were born: which season (or month if you like precision) did the sperm of your father impregnate the egg of your mother?

And in November this sacred encounter occurred between my dad's sperm and my mom's egg. Summer is starting. The heat is approaching. What comes to mind for me is that I don't care much what the season of the year is. I do not care. And we started criticizing myself again, because I don't care, because I don't remember. Because I'm lost. Because I don't know about me. Because I don't know where to go. Where to move forward. Because the only thing there is is criticism.

Well, life, my parents have taught me that the things that matter must be respected, cared for, admired, respected the silences of the trio, the lives of others, especially animals, cared for and kept, treasured. with caresses, kisses, love, massages, hugs, many hugs. Nothing more beautiful than preparing a meal, a delicious snack, for someone you love. It is not possible for us to not respect the beings we love. and the animals of this planet. I want there to be no suffering for those innocent beings. I even feel more empathy for them than for the human being himself. Those victims of war who hardly appear on TV hurt me a lot, or who are victims of intentional fires, hectares, houses, cars are burned, but in every tree crown on every leaf there is an insect, a bird, a rabbit, a squirrel. , a lost kitten.

We are recognizing ourselves in that warmth that we feel. We are receiving that heat. What memories do I have of that time?\n\nWhat comes is when classes end. I remember playing myths and legends cards, waiting for time to pass. I remember that I don't remember. that I'm alone that there is a lot of loneliness in me, that existential loneliness that makes me not clear if there is something wrong with me, if there is something that I have to improve. If there is something that I have to process, and that I am not doing it well. if there is something that needs to be built in a new way. embracing something new. remembering something new. inventing something new.

In Chile it is winter, so it would be a bit cold. After I was born I moved to Sweden and it was still cold. The thing is that we traveled a lot in my childhood from hemisphere to hemisphere, so when we were in Europe it was hot at that time. The energy of summer is very different from that of winter. I love winter, I hadn't thought about it until now, maybe it's because I was conceived in winter and I was born when spring arrived in April. I love the silence of winter, the rain, staying warm at home next to the stove and in the best of cases the fire. I don't have a problem with any season to be honest, I think that traveling so much made me very adaptable. Extreme heat doesn't fascinate me, though.

I don't have many specific memories of March; There is a recent one that I used to look forward to every year, which are the memes against Benito Juarez, or more than against, rather telling the truth about that guy; He was president, he was re-elected several times in Mexico, he wanted to sell a part of the country to the United States in exchange for recognition of his presidency and other atrocities that official history does not tell because what they say is that he was a great president because supposedly in his childhood He was a little shepherd, it's his great feat... now it turns out that I don't know how to spell feat, I think it takes h... let's see... feat... oh yes it takes. In March there are spring dances in the kindergartens, I guess at some point they dressed me as a butterfly or something, I don't remember. Recently we were watching some VHS and the one who liked to dance was my sister, so there are videos of her dressed in many things like the little mermaid, a Cuban, and I don't remember what else, but there were several.

I like long storng hugs, in fact, I am highly regarded as a world-class hugger. I can express so much more with my hands than with my words. I absolutely adore and worship my goddess, and I give her all the attention by wobbling her ass, just randomly in the kitchen, and for hours when we have sexual play. I give more affection via my hands than I am able to do with my spoken words. Why is that? Perhaps because being non-verbal feels safer? My hands are so trained to invoke positive feelings on the skin on another person, whereas my spoken words have, in the past at least, often cause irritations, hurt, anger and other negative feelings in others. I also touch my teenage son a lot, like from behind, hugging him around his shoulders and chest, to give him the reassurance of his papa that he is ok and the it's all going to work out. I can embody this with utmost confidence, wheras in the spoken word, I guess, I sometimes have doubt in my voice, which then I notice and then I wonder if the other person notices this, and then I might feel a bit more nervous, and that becomes a vicious cycle.

On the other hand, I do consider that through my interactions, I can show compassion, although with many people I shouldn't, it is all very complex to be able to express it, so lightly, which is why I think it is quite the opposite, that it really shows something else even though I feel Another, sometimes you do not choose how the other person reacts to your interactions since each person has a perspective on each action, each person creates their reality, you can do something for their good and that person think the opposite.

Everything was blooming. whether in the nature or people's minds. if the month was january, then it was cold, but even though there was not enough good food, people found depth in their experience. sometimes i wish that time continued into the present, but maybe it exists in other people's days, not as much in my own. i wish there was more to say about the birches, but all they were doing was standing and listening to the wind howl quietly but coldly, freezingly. snow sometimes turned to a crispy ice on its top and reflected the brightest sun ever known to crows in this side of town. the houses were mostly heated with coal, and one could smell that smoke eerywhere through the city. i wonder if the streetcar track was there or if it was built later. probably it was, just laying there, dividing the city in square and triangle parts. i love winter. i love going into the banya and then running out into the snow, sometimes, i just wish i was there fully present, but i guess i needed to learn that lesson. hindsight is not a trait common to many. or maybe it is but everyone's hiding it, even from themselves. we kinda know what's going to happen. who are we? who am i\ni will find out<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nTravel back nine months before you were born: which season (or month if you like precision) did the sperm of your father impregnate the egg of your mother?

Beyond the stereotyped romanticism of spring, there exists within me a strange, and very transcendental fixation with the buds of trees that seem dead in winter. There is something extraordinary about that event. The most fragile part of the shoot is capable of breaking the bark of the tree, and with infinite tenderness, super special colors appear in the light of day.\nThose colors also reflect something in my life. They are the colors I am using right now in my clothes.\nIt is spectacular to understand that a scenario existed before you even had eyes formed in your skull, you were inhabiting the earth, who knows in how many forms before incarnating in a dense physical body.\nThese scenarios taught us other essential aspects of life.\nSpring must have helped romanticize my parents' union.\nAnd that feeling, if some formality was transmitted.\nI also remember the greening of the Andes, and their miniature flowers, covering a meadow on the southern slope.<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nTravel back nine months before you were born: which season (or month if you like precision) did the sperm of your father impregnate the egg of your mother?

A dozen neighborhood children flocked around her, chattering excitedly as she unpacked boxes of art supplies onto long tables. She smiled warmly, ruffling a little girl's hair. \n\n\"Who's ready to make some magic?\" Luna asked, met by a chorus of cheers.\n\nThe kids gathered around as Luna displayed examples of mandalas, explaining their symbolic meaning in different cultures. She spoke enthusiastically about self-expression, imagination, and finding beauty in imperfection. A little boy raised his hand.\n\n\"Miss Luna, can we make our own mandalas about stuff we love?\" \n\n\"Of course! That's the whole idea,\" she said. \"Now let's begin...\"\n\nLuna wandered around the room, admiring the kids' creations taking shape. Each mandala reflected their unique interests and personalities - flowers, superheroes, animals, favorite foods. She paused to help a shy girl blend her watercolors, praising the ocean scene emerging on the paper. \n\nTwo boys argued over an art supply. \"Ah ah, we create together here,\" Luna gently reminded them. Their frowns softened as she redirected their energy into adding to each other's mandalas. Laughter soon filled the room again.\n\nAs the morning sun climbed higher, Luna stepped back, overcome with pride at the joyful chaos. This was why she coordinated community art programs - to kindle creativity, connection, and empowerment. Watching the children share their visions, she saw the seeds of a more vibrant, inclusive world.\n\n\"Five minutes left, little artists!\" Luna called out. The kids scrambled to add finishing touches, signing their names with flourish. She moved among them, complimenting unique details and techniques. \n\nToo soon, parents arrived to pick up their beaming children, mandalas held high. \"Thank you, Miss Luna!\" they chorused before scampering away, already chattering about their next creation. \n\nLuna smiled tiredly as she cleaned up scattered supplies. She lived for these communal moments of unleashed creativity, knowing that art could unite and empower communities. Witnessing the children translate imagination into expression filled her spirit.\n\nThe beach was deserted, save for Luna's solitary figure strolling by the water's edge. She relished these quiet moments alone after the morning's lively chaos. The rhythm of the waves calmed her active mind as she ambled past weathered driftwood, sea glass glinting in the sand. \n\nFinding a secluded cove, Luna settled cross-legged on a blanket, gazing out at the vast ocean. She inhaled deeply, breathing in the mingling scents of salt, earth, and pine. A light breeze caressed her skin as she closed her eyes, focusing inward. \n\nSlowing her breathing, Luna began mentally tracing an invisible mandala - a symbol of harmony, balance, and spiritual awakening. Each line and curve centered her further, opening a sacred inner space. Releasing thought, she touched a deeper wisdom, where her essence connected to the elements - water, wind, earth. \n\nLuna opened her eyes, picking up a seashell. Turning it slowly, she contemplated how life's beauty emerges gradually through quiet growth. She thought of the children from that morning, like seedlings beginning to unfurl. Her role was to nurture their creativity so it could bloom in myriad directions.\n\nThe fading light drew Luna's gaze upward, where the first faint stars appeared in the dusky sky. She inhaled the day's last warmth, gathering herself before the chill of evening set in. \n\nTomorrow would bring new seeds to nurture, more creativity to cultivate in her little corner of the world. But tonight, Luna would paint by candlelight - translating the day's inspiration into art, and waiting for the next sunrise.<|im_end|>\n"]}
