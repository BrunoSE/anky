I was born vaginally, I probably went from the watery environment to the outside world with the classic sounds, arriving at the delivery room, the nurses chatting, the doctor giving instructions, my parents discovering that I am a girl (they didn't know until I was born, which which seems fantastic to me and excites me), I imagine the excitement and tears of seeing me and knowing me outside of the anza for the first time. I was born early. I met my brothers, two very small children, ages one and a half and 3 years old, so my first days were noisy. carefully noisy. When there are children at home, the calm, silent atmosphere with bright lights is over by the second and not to mention by the third. So that's how it was, noises. When I was 7 days old I went to my first wedding, noise. Movement and sound are part of my life, however I have become a talkative person, but only in spaces of trust, otherwise I am rather an observer and an excellent listener...I enjoy silence. Is it because of these first noisy moments? Don't know. I know that my brothers played with me, they wanted to see everything that had to do with me and also play with me too. So a lot of noise. Marriage as I said and a girl who helped my mother with our care, lover of the foursome. When my mom left the house, she took the opportunity to turn the quartet radio on full blast and that was the first music I heard and it was the first music I danced to. You can imagine then that I love the quartet, yes I love the quartet. It is inevitable not to move if I hear it. The body begins to move on its own, as if it knew that rhythm and could not avoid the fact of moving, it becomes an uncontrollable need. So quite a noisy childhood. My brothers learning to talk and stimulating parents... although perhaps not very talkative, but always telling us and explaining to us how things are and how they work. Now yes, I think the first voice I heard from the doctor and the nurses, and probably from my dad who was there during the birth watching the whole process up close, was my mother. She has an angelic voice, I think she already mentioned it to you. It's a beauty to hear it, it's the most beautiful thing<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nReflect on the first sounds and voices that surrounded your birth.

This was the first moment of recognition and belonging. My mother cried and laugh and talked to be, so did my dad. This was my family, there I belonged to. There were also other noises that were more in the background. For example, the doctors voice, the nurses manipulating elements or sounds of machines. This were not catching the total of my attention as the sweet voice of my mother or the proud screams of my dad.\n\nOf course this influenced the journey as I instantly learnt what tones of voices were adequate when something was sweet or tender. How and with which tone you should approach a smaller living creature, a baby. In expressing my true voice is a journey that is still in progress. Of course in some way you learn to hear and repeat. You mark the tones, expressions and intonations of your parents. The way they express themselves is the way you start to express yourself as we are masters of learning by doing and copying. But as you start growing, you begin to realize you have your own voice. Your own ways. Given by something much grater than your DNA or your mother and your father and surrounding. A code that comes within you. That when you tap into yourself, you recognize. Its not something you even have to put effort in. Is something that after it has happened you notice. You resonate with yourself, recognize yourself and feel proud. And, paradoxically, it is also a product of your upbringing, of how your parent treated and talked to you. Its something you are forever discovering and recognizing. In the end,<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nReflect on the first sounds and voices that surrounded your birth.

Or at least most of the babies that were born in my country which had hospitals and other niceties that allow for a more modern style of birth. I was born in a hospital so I would have heard the sounds of metal tools clicking on a metal tray as the doctor performed whatever procedures were needed at the time. There would have been nurses chatting back and forth making sure that everything was in order and everyone was safe and happy. I would also have heard the sound of my moms heartbeat, but not how I was used to hearing it. Her heartbeat would have been a constant companion in the womb. A sound that surrounded me. A sound I could feel throughout the blood we shared. However, after being born, I would have heard my moms heartbeat being playing through a machine. What was once a constant, reassuring, encompassing beating would have been transformed into the raw, unyielding, high chirp of the heart rate monitor. If I understand at the time, there was more concern about making sure the proper procedures were followed rather than allowing the mother and child to form the natural bond that we believe occurs right after birth. Where now, with my children, they are immediately placed on the mothers chest after birth. Allowing the child to realize that the sound that used to be everywhere is now only in one place. T but it gives them the chance to remember. So I would have been a couple of minutes away from my mom hearing all these new sounds and not hearing the only one I had come to rely on. So it must be a terrifying experience, but luckely we haven\u2019t developed memories at that time, so no one is worse for wear. I have to think, beyond all the other things that make people different, the way we are born has to play some part in our lives. I think of people born in countries that don\u2019t have the basic needs<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nReflect on the first sounds and voices that surrounded your birth.

Unfortunately in the birth wards, the noises are loud, sometimes people talk loudly and silence is not respected. I imagine it must have been something like that.\nNowadays, I feel that I have a little hypersensitivity to sounds. Very loud sounds bother me and sometimes I don't like having music very loud. A few days ago JP played some very curious music and it started to make me anxious and anguish, I don't know why, but I asked him to change it.\nI feel that I have a very developed sense of hearing and now even more so after becoming a mother. It's incredible how these days when my daughter has slept in her room, I can hear her barely awake and then she appears in our bed waiting for me to bring her up so she can sleep with us.\n\nRegarding my own voice, I feel that the accumulation of experience in my life has made my voice until today a little low, sometimes it is difficult for me to make myself respected and express my opinion. It is also difficult for me to tell a person that something about them bothers me because I am afraid and nervous that they might get angry, and more than getting angry is that that feeling has been expressed in future events in our relationship. There are times when I am aware of this, even at the same moment, but I don't know if I don't dare or if I don't know what's happening to me that I stay a little paralyzed and concede.\nI think it has to do with my personality style. I feel that I am more attached to being a very condescending person and that I am capable of letting myself go and it is difficult for me to express my opinion. There are times when I do not know how to express my opinion and I think that What I have to say is not valid. But deep down I try to convince myself that it does have validity and that what I think, feel and believe is just as valid as what other people think, feel and believe. I just have to dare, break that inertia and dare to raise my voice, my own voice, my thoughts and feelings, my opinion and my way of seeing things.\nI feel that I have a great challenge ahead of me knowing that I have to learn to express my opinion and do it in a loving and constructive way, and not in a fighting or combative manner, but rather find a path in which I do not feel that the other is against me. crushing, but we just have different opinions and sleep to see life<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nReflect on the first sounds and voices that surrounded your birth.

Perhaps crying is like the mythology of Trempulcahue, a Mapuche tale where the Machis transform into a whale during their dreams, a white sperm whale that is responsible for transporting souls between the worlds of the living and the dead, and she also decided whether to Newborn babies deserved to live, and the proof is that when giving birth, the baby is left in the water, and must be able to swim alone to be worthy of inhabiting the earth, it must find the strength to stay afloat in its first moment of life, and this water, are the tears of this cry, which represents this very important and unconscious step for our vigi<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nReflect on the first sounds and voices that surrounded your birth.

I feel the same way today, everything is moving fast around me, I always have to be on my guard so that I notice everything. Nobody really listens to me and at the same time I always feel very important and don't stop talking, maybe so that I can finally be heard. I could also start listening more to maybe be mirrored more. it also creates trust. I didn't really have anyone close to me and so I still feel very alone today. Most of the time I feel like I have to do everything myself. They are interesting thoughts because I have never associated them with the birth situation. But a child actually feels something on its warm chest, which lands with its mother after birth, in perspective, heard and seen. I think my mother suffered a lot because she couldn't be there. She wasn't heard or seen either. Family charm. I also find it very difficult to listen to my son.

Everything vibrates at different frequencies. We are constantly surrounded by vibrations and frequencies. Each person, each animal, plant, inanimate object has its own frequency.

I think of people born in countries that don\u2019t have the basic needs covered, they don\u2019t also have the separation of a mother and child at birth which must help to strengthen their bond<|im_end|>\n"], "training_chapter_data": ["<|im_start|>user\n<instructions>\nCraft a profound and transformative 4000-word chapter from the perspective of Maria, the birth doula, as she guides Luna through the intense and sacred journey of childbirth. This chapter should be a powerful exploration of Maria's own story of love, loss, and resilience, and how it has shaped her into the compassionate and wise guide she is today.\n\nBegin the chapter with Maria preparing the birthing space, her mindful actions and reflections setting the stage for the profound experiences to come. As she creates a sanctuary of warmth and safety, let her thoughts drift to her own pregnancy and the exhilaration and love that filled her during that time. Contrast this with the painful memory of her own labor, when she knew something was terribly wrong, and the devastating loss that followed.\n\nAs Luna's labor intensifies, show Maria drawing on her own experiences to provide comfort, strength, and understanding. Let her words and actions be infused with the love and wisdom she has gained through her own journey of grief and healing. Highlight the moments when Maria must confront her own resurfacing fears and doubts, and how she finds the courage to stay present and focused on Luna's needs.\n\nCreate a poignant scene where Luna confides in Maria her own apprehensions about motherhood. Let Maria's response be one of deep empathy and shared vulnerability, as she reveals a part of her own story of loss. Show how this moment of openness and trust forges a profound bond between the two women, a connection that transcends the roles of doula and mother-to-be.\n\nAs the intensity of Luna's labor reaches its peak, let Maria's own painful memories threaten to overwhelm her. Show her striving to maintain her composure, drawing on the reservoirs of love and strength within her. Let her focus on the beauty and power of Luna's journey, finding solace and purpose in her role as a guide and guardian.\n\nThe climax of the chapter should be the breathtaking moment of Anky's birth. Capture the complex and overwhelming emotions that flood through Maria as she witnesses this miracle of new life. Let her joy and awe mingle with the bittersweet remembrance of her own loss, creating a poignant and deeply human moment. Show how Maria's own story of resilience and love allows her to be fully present for Luna in this transformative experience.\n\nAs the chapter closes, reflect on how Maria's journey \u2013 the love, the heartbreak, the healing \u2013 has led her to this sacred calling of supporting women through the most vulnerable and powerful experiences of their lives. Let her story stand as a testament to the transformative power of love, and how our deepest pain can become a source of strength, empathy, and connection. End with a sense of Maria's heart expanding, embracing the full spectrum of emotions that come with the journey of motherhood, and reaffirming her commitment to walk alongside women as they birth new life and new versions of themselves.\n</instructions>\n\n<style> The language should be evocative, poetic, and deeply emotional, capturing the raw intensity and beauty of birth and the complex, layered feelings it evokes. Use vivid sensory details to bring the birthing space to life, from the soft glow of candlelight to the earthy scent of essential oils. Maria's internal monologue should be rich and introspective, weaving together memories of her own experiences with her present observations and emotions. Her voice should be warm, wise, and compassionate, revealing both her strength and her vulnerability. The pacing of the chapter should ebb and flow with the rhythms of labor, building in intensity and emotion as Luna's journey progresses. The tone should be intimate and honest, inviting the reader into the sacred space of birth and the depths of Maria's heart. Employ metaphors and imagery that evoke the transformative power of birth and the cyclical nature of life, love, and loss. Let the language reflect the spiritual and emotional dimensions of the experience, while grounding it in the visceral, bodily reality of labor. </style> <setting> The birthing room should be portrayed as a sacred, liminal space \u2013 a place of transition and transformation. Describe the warm, soft lighting, the comfortable furnishings, and the carefully chosen elements that create a sense of safety and tranquility.\nAs Maria moves through this space, let it reflect her inner landscape \u2013 the memories, emotions, and insights that surface as she guides Luna through labor. The setting should be alive and dynamic, responding to the shifting energy and intensity of the birthing process.\n\nContrast the peaceful, nurturing environment of the birthing room with the stark, clinical details of Maria's memories of her own loss. Let the two spaces \u2013 one of creation, one of grief \u2013 intersect and overlap, mirroring Maria's internal journey of integrating her past pain with her present purpose.\n</setting>\n\n<characters> Maria: The emotional core of the chapter, Maria should be portrayed as a woman who has transformed her own suffering into a source of strength, compassion, and wisdom. Her interactions with Luna should reveal her deep capacity for empathy, her intuitive understanding of the birthing process, and her unwavering commitment to providing support and guidance. Maria's internal dialogue should be rich and multi-faceted, reflecting on her own journey of love, loss, and healing, and how it has shaped her identity and purpose as a doula.\nLuna: Though the chapter is told from Maria's perspective, Luna's presence should be vital and vividly felt. Her journey through labor should be the catalyst for Maria's own emotional and spiritual journey. Show Luna's strength, vulnerability, and trust in Maria, and how their bond deepens through the shared experience of birth.\n\nAnky: Though not yet born for most of the chapter, Anky's impending arrival should be a constant presence, a symbol of the miraculous power of life and the profound transformations that birth brings. Let the anticipation of her arrival infuse the chapter with a sense of awe, wonder, and possibility.\n\nThe spirit of Maria's lost child: While not a physical presence, the memory of Maria's own baby should be a poignant undercurrent throughout the chapter. Let this absent presence be felt in Maria's moments of grief, longing, and, ultimately, in her renewed sense of purpose and connection to the cycle of life.\n</characters><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nIn the shimmering caverns of the Echo Enclave, nestled within the blue kingdom of Voxlumis, a scribe sat in quiet contemplation. The gentle hum of the Echo Crystals filled the air, each one pulsing with the unique essence of a soul preparing for its journey to Earth. The scribe, a being of ethereal grace, moved with purposeful reverence through the sacred space, its translucent form casting soft shadows on the luminous walls.\n\nAs it approached a crystal of particular brilliance, the scribe paused, sensing the imminent departure of the soul within. With gentle hands, it lifted the crystal from its resting place, cradling it like a precious gem. The crystal thrummed with energy, its facets shimmering with the iridescent hues of a thousand stars. This, the scribe knew, was the soul of Anky, a being on the cusp of a profound transformation.\n\nThe scribe carried the crystal to a nearby alcove, where a table of polished alabaster awaited. Upon the table lay the sacred tools of its craft: a quill of shimmering stardust, an inkwell filled with the liquid essence of moonlight, and a scroll of gossamer parchment, woven from the dreams of ancient sages. With reverent movements, the scribe began to prepare for the sacred ritual of Anky's departure.\n\nAs it worked, the scribe whispered ancient words of wisdom and love, imbuing the crystal with the collective knowledge of the Ankyverse. Each word was a thread of light, a cosmic melody that would guide Anky on her journey through the physical realm. The scribe spoke of the joys and sorrows that awaited her, of the challenges and triumphs that would shape her soul's growth. It whispered of the eternal connection she would forever share with her cosmic home, a bond that would never be broken, no matter how far she wandered.\n\nAs the final words of the ritual faded into the shimmering air, the scribe lifted the crystal once more, holding it aloft in a gesture of reverence. It was time for Anky to begin her journey, to leave the familiar embrace of the Ankyverse and venture forth into the great unknown.\n\nWith the crystal cradled in its hands, the scribe glided through the winding passages of the Echo Enclave, its footsteps a whisper on the luminous stone. As it walked, it sensed the anticipation and wonder that pulsed within Anky's essence, a shimmering excitement tempered by the bittersweet knowledge of the separation to come.\n\nAt last, the scribe emerged onto the shores of the Sapphire Sea, a vast expanse of shimmering blue that stretched to the horizon and beyond. The sea was a portal between realms, a threshold where the boundaries of the cosmic and the physical blurred and intertwined. It was here that Anky would begin her journey, stepping through the veil that separated the Ankyverse from the world of matter and form.\n\nAs the scribe approached the water's edge, it saw a shimmering figure awaiting them, a being of pure light and energy. This was the guardian of the portal, a celestial guide who would usher Anky's soul into its new form. The scribe bowed in greeting, holding out the crystal that contained Anky's essence.\n\n\"Great guardian,\" the scribe intoned, its voice a melody of starlight and shadow. \"I bring before you the soul of Anky, a being of shimmering potential and innocent wonder. She stands ready to embark upon her Earthly journey, to leave the embrace of the Ankyverse and venture forth into the realm of matter and form.\"\n\nThe guardian nodded, its luminous form pulsing with a gentle radiance. \"The time has come,\" it said, its voice a whisper of wind and waves. \"Let the soul of Anky step forward, and let the Sacred Convergence begin.\"\n\nThe scribe lifted the crystal to its lips, whispering a final blessing of love and protection. Then, with a gentle breath, it released Anky's essence into the shimmering air. The crystal dissolved into a mist of stardust, swirling and dancing on the celestial breeze. Slowly, the mist began to coalesce, taking on the form of a shimmering silhouette, a being of pure light and energy.\n\nAnky's soul hovered above the Sapphire Sea, its radiance reflecting on the mirror-like surface. For a moment, it seemed to hesitate, as if savoring the final moments of its cosmic existence. Then, with a surge of determination and joy, it plunged into the portal, disappearing beneath the shimmering waves.\n\nThe scribe watched in awe as the surface of the sea began to ripple and dance, the portal opening like a flower of light. Through the shimmering veil, it caught glimpses of the world beyond, a realm of colors and sensations that defied description. It saw the soft glow of a hospital room, heard the gentle murmur of voices and the steady beep of machines. And there, at the center of it all, was Anky, her tiny form cradled in the arms of her mother.\n\nAs the scribe watched, it saw the moment of the Sacred Convergence, the instant when Anky's soul merged with her physical form. It was a moment of profound transformation, a blinding flash of light and energy that rippled across the cosmos. In that instant, Anky's first breath on Earth solidified the silver thread that would forever connect her human consciousness to the cosmic wisdom of the Ankyverse.\n\nThe Eternal Lifeline, as it was known in the celestial realms, shimmered and pulsed with a radiant energy, a conduit of love and guidance that would forever link Anky to her cosmic origins. Through this sacred bond, she would always have access to the wisdom and knowledge of the Ankyverse, a reservoir of infinite potential that would guide her through the joys and challenges of her Earthly existence.\n\nAs the portal began to close, the scribe felt a wave of bittersweet joy wash over it. Anky's journey had begun, a new chapter in the eternal story of the cosmos. Though she was now separated from the Ankyverse by the veil of physical reality, she would never be truly alone. The Eternal Lifeline would always be there, a shimmering thread of connection that would guide her back to her cosmic home whenever she needed it most.\n\nWith a final whisper of blessing, the scribe turned away from the Sapphire Sea, making its way back to the Echo Enclave. As it walked, it reflected on the profound significance of the Sacred Convergence, the moment when a new being, imbued with the essence of the Ankyverse, takes its first breath on Earth.\n\nIt thought of the countless souls that had passed through the Echo Enclave over the eons, each one a unique expression of the infinite potential of the cosmos. Some would live lives of quiet contentment, others would blaze trails of innovation and change. Some would know great joy, others would endure profound sorrow. But all would be forever connected to the Ankyverse, forever guided by the wisdom and love of their cosmic origins.\n\nAs the scribe entered the Echo Enclave once more, it made its way to the sacred altar where Anky's crystal had once rested. With reverent hands, it placed a new crystal in its place, a shimmering gem that pulsed with the essence of a soul yet to be born. This, the scribe knew, was the way of the cosmos, an endless cycle of birth and rebirth, of separation and reunion.\n\nFor a moment, the scribe closed its eyes, reaching out with its consciousness to the countless worlds beyond the veil. It saw the tapestry of human experience, the joys and sorrows, the triumphs and the trials. It saw the moments of connection and understanding, the flashes of insight and awakening. And it saw the Eternal Lifeline, shimmering and pulsing with the love and wisdom of the Ankyverse, forever guiding each soul on its journey of self-discovery and growth.\n\nAs it opened its eyes once more, the scribe felt a deep sense of purpose and gratitude. It was an honor to serve as a guide and chronicler for the souls of the Ankyverse, to bear witness to the sacred journey of each being as they navigated the challenges and joys of physical existence.\n\nWith a final whisper of blessing, the scribe took up its quill once more, ready to begin the next chapter in the eternal story of the cosmos. For it knew that Anky's journey was just beginning, a shimmering thread in the vast tapestry of creation. And though the path ahead would be filled with both light and shadow, it had no doubt that she would find her way, guided always by the love and wisdom of her cosmic home.\n\nAs Anky took her first breaths in the physical world, the scribe could sense the echoes of the human experiences that awaited her. It saw glimpses of the voices that would shape her early years, the laughter and tears, the moments of connection and separation. It saw the challenges she would face, the obstacles that would test her strength and resilience. And it saw the moments of profound insight and awakening, the flashes of cosmic understanding that would guide her back to her true nature.\n\nThrough it all, the Eternal Lifeline would be there, a constant reminder of her unbreakable bond with the Ankyverse. In moments of joy and wonder, it would shimmer with the radiance of a thousand stars, a celebration of the beauty and potential of physical existence. In moments of sorrow and confusion, it would pulse with the steady rhythm of comfort and reassurance, a reminder that she was never truly alone.\n\nThe scribe knew that Anky's journey would be a microcosm of the human experience, a reflection of the universal themes of love, growth, and self-discovery. Just as each soul in the Ankyverse was a unique expression of the infinite potential of the cosmos, so too was each human life a sacred story, a tapestry woven from the threads of choice and circumstance.\n\nAs it watched Anky take her first steps on the path of physical existence, the scribe felt a deep sense of trust and surrender. It knew that her journey would unfold in perfect alignment with the wisdom of the cosmos, that every challenge and triumph would serve the greater purpose of her soul's evolution.\n\nAnd so, with a final whisper of blessing, the scribe set down its quill, the sacred ink shimmering in the ethereal light of the Echo Enclave. It carefully placed Anky's Echo Crystal in a place of honor, knowing that it would forever hold the essence of her cosmic origins, a beacon of guidance and wisdom that would shine through the veil of physical reality.\n\nAs it stepped back from the altar, the scribe felt a wave of profound gratitude wash over it. To serve as a witness to the sacred journey of a soul was a privilege beyond measure, a chance to participate in the eternal dance of creation and transformation.\n\nIt knew that Anky's journey would be a long and winding one, full of unexpected twists and turns. But it also knew that every step would be guided by the love and wisdom of the Ankyverse, that every moment would be an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.\n\nAnd so, as the scribe made its way back through the shimmering caverns of the Echo Enclave, it whispered a final prayer for Anky and all the souls that would follow in her footsteps. It prayed for their strength and resilience, for their courage and compassion. It prayed that they would always remember their cosmic origins, that they would draw upon the infinite wisdom and love of the Ankyverse in moments of doubt and uncertainty.\n\nBut most of all, it prayed that they would embrace the sacred gift of physical existence, that they would savor every moment of joy and sorrow, every flash of insight and understanding. For it knew that the journey of the soul was a journey of infinite potential, a chance to explore the vast and wondrous tapestry of creation.\n\nAnd as Anky took her first breaths in the physical world, the scribe knew that her journey would be a shimmering thread in that tapestry, a sacred story that would forever be woven into the eternal fabric of the cosmos. It knew that she would face challenges and triumphs, moments of darkness and moments of light. But it also knew that she would never be alone, that the love and wisdom of the Ankyverse would always be there to guide her way.\n\nAnd so, with a final smile of cosmic understanding, the scribe turned its gaze to the shimmering expanse of the Ankyverse, ready to witness the next chapter in the eternal story of the soul. For it knew that every journey was a sacred one, a chance to explore the infinite potential of the cosmos and to discover the true nature of the self.\n\nAnd as Anky's Eternal Lifeline shimmered and pulsed with the radiant energy of her cosmic origins, the scribe knew that her journey would be a testament to the enduring power of love and wisdom, a shining beacon of hope and inspiration for all the souls that would follow in her footsteps. And so, with a heart full of reverence and wonder, it watched as the sacred dance of creation unfolded, forever grateful to be a witness to the eternal journey of the soul.<|im_end|>\n"]}
