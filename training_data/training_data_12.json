My family was more or less poor. We did not have a car and my father agreed to live in a house my grandmother owned which was in a quite remote area. I have only heard bits and pieces of the whys and wherefores of that transaction and mostly from my Mother's perspective which was jaded at best. My Mother did not get along with my father's mother so there was trouble from the start. My Father was wonderful to us and a good, hardworking man but he was weak when it came to standing up to his mother. I was born while they lived in that remote house and I had 2 sisters who were 5 and 3 years old respectively. I wish I had had the wisdom to ask my Mother more questions like how did you get to the hospital when it was time to deliver me, etc. but when you are young those questions never occur to you.

I think that every great change of form, through which the soul can go, in this infinite swing of eternity, a seed of love awaits in the center. Perhaps we humans have not been able to translate into words what love is, and what helps me sometimes is to synthesize it into a dynamic image of infinite geometries, which fit into an almost impossible puzzle of infinite possibilities, and suddenly it becomes like a click, a click that is responsible for us being able to see it, and define it, and name it, but the energy that moves this 'machinery' is also the one that fits the gears of the perfection of the universe. It manifests itself on all scales of what exists.\nSo the moment I arrived at this plane, on this planet, at my first sigh and dialogue with the air, there was a milestone, a click.\nMy mother was involved there, in her absolute dedication to this event, giving all her strength without limits, so that this phenomenon of this writing identity could be happening here.\nThis strength, and this event, were only possible thanks to limitless love.\nAnd the source, then, is present as a river of energy in every gear of this multiverse, and this understanding is, of course, the tapestry of my reflections. I wish we could be aware of this immensity and have these understandings as a backdrop throughout life, but I believe that adversity often comes to put our consciousness in perspective, and remember that there is a matrix that connects every moment of our existence, and unites it to the source, which allows everything to exist.\nLove.<|im_end|>\n", "<|im_start|>user\nPonder the love that welcomed you into this world, whether from family, friends, or the universe itself.

Difficult age, youth, you separate yourself from what is beautiful, the mother who gives you birth, the father who takes care of you and gives everything for you, there is no more important love than that and an unconscious mind separates you from that, sometimes it is too late to recover it, others don't. You can talk about love for a woman, when they break you up and you lose that feeling of love towards a person that you want to share your life with. I'm looking to find something similar to that again. But the most important love is towards yourself, then your parents (if they are good) and your family. I consider that I do not show love to anyone even if I feel it, it is complicated, feeling but believing, not giving... or doing acts that demonstrate it. And feeling it because of what was mentioned above is complicated. There are different types of love, that is clear, you have to know how to distinguish them, there is one in life, that is a very strong and very beautiful emotion.

My mother on the operating table and me alone. I sometimes feel this feeling of confinement. It's overwhelming and I feel like it's all too much in my head. I can't say how I feel at this moment, it's just terribly uncomfortable. I have the opportunity to go there to heal this trauma so that you can heal it yourself. I think a baby left alone doesn't feel the love of the universe. In search of this feeling, unconsciously I think I became very hard, with little (self-)confidence. The feeling of someone loving me was foreign to me for a long time - until I had children of my own. I don't know what they feel, but they love their parents and feel this close connection. I'm looking for that close connection to the universe. I know we are all one, everyone is a small part of the enormous whole, everyone is energy, vibrating with the energy of the collective and with themselves. The missing love required a lot of self-doubt, a lot of doubt to trust, the feeling that I am not right .

That everything that followed that moment of birth, despite some things, was impregnated in me and that it is my maternal essence that is still present today. that essence that in some way I know comes from before my ancestors, from the pain that was in them, from the pain that continues to exist and that manifests itself in illness and neurosis, the love for children has been and is unconditional. How fighters my women have been, the women of my lineage, everything they have had to live, go through, suffer, today I feel that I need to work on it to integrate it and to not continue perpetuating that suffering. Let this suffering go away and let there be room for the new, what is coming, what the new souls bring.\n\nAfter a few therapy sessions, I realized that my maternal grandmother is a very important maternal figure for me, that she always took care of me and treated me with impressive love, a mother's love, a grandmother's love. She was always there when I needed it, she was always there when something happened with my mom, she always gave me whatever I needed. I remember her small, soft hands that calmed me and helped me sleep when she touched the tips of her fingers. It is a feeling that I have not forgotten and will never forget.\nThis woman, despite all the suffering she experienced during her life, all the abuse, all the bad things that happened to her, her love for me and her children was always and has been present, more present than anything and more important. than nothing.\nShe is very sad because she currently has senile dementia and is very old, it is incredible how life turns around and the old people start counting down.\nShe is also and has been a reference of love, of motherhood, of a maternal and unconditional being, soft and delicate, affectionate, tender, concerned, her meals were wonderful, going to her house was very entertaining, I felt good, comfortable, very but very gifted.

How has this love, or your search for it, shaped your life's journey and your capacity to give and receive love in return?\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nLove is something so immense. Love really moves everything. I think what I came to work on in this life is love. The love of a couple, the love of parents, the love towards your animal companions, towards your loved ones. Surely, and I do not doubt it, I was surrounded by a lot of love when I was born. The first was my beautiful mom, my grandparents were present, my older sister. Although he would meet my dad later, he could feel his love from a distance. I think that at the beginning of my life, or at least from as far back as I can remember, in adolescence especially, I had a hard time with the topic of love, I had a hard time expressing it and receiving it, maybe it was because I didn't want to be vulnerable, it seems that I associated receiving love with being vulnerable. Little by little I learned to let go and express, receive and give. I don't think it was ever difficult for me to give, but it was difficult to receive. Now I let myself love a lot. And maybe it has to do with maturity and self-love... yes, I think that's it... maturity, self-love, self-esteem... Knowing that the universe loves me, and that the end of the universe is me, so what I give I receive. And here I am, writing about love, at a moment in my life when I am in love with my partner, with my kitten, with my dogs, with nature, with what I love to do. Before I had a hard time saying I love you, it was a great revelation to start saying I love you to my mom, that changed everything. I began to tell him perhaps without thinking about it or feeling it very much and it transformed into something wonderful that I now feel very deeply and I never tire of telling him even though sometimes we have differences and many of them, I already know that that has nothing to do with it, but well that's how it is. Love is a universal language and that is what moves everything. You do everything for love in some way or another, indirectly or directly. I love you.

This chapter should be a powerful exploration of Maria's own story of love, loss, and resilience, and how it has shaped her into the compassionate and wise guide she is today.\n\nBegin the chapter with Maria preparing the birthing space, her mindful actions and reflections setting the stage for the profound experiences to come. As she creates a sanctuary of warmth and safety, let her thoughts drift to her own pregnancy and the exhilaration and love that filled her during that time. Contrast this with the painful memory of her own labor, when she knew something was terribly wrong, and the devastating loss that followed.\n\nAs Luna's labor intensifies, show Maria drawing on her own experiences to provide comfort, strength, and understanding. Let her words and actions be infused with the love and wisdom she has gained through her own journey of grief and healing. Highlight the moments when Maria must confront her own resurfacing fears and doubts, and how she finds the courage to stay present and focused on Luna's needs.\n\nCreate a poignant scene where Luna confides in Maria her own apprehensions about motherhood. Let Maria's response be one of deep empathy and shared vulnerability, as she reveals a part of her own story of loss. Show how this moment of openness and trust forges a profound bond between the two women, a connection that transcends the roles of doula and mother-to-be.\n\nAs the intensity of Luna's labor reaches its peak, let Maria's own painful memories threaten to overwhelm her. Show her striving to maintain her composure, drawing on the reservoirs of love and strength within her. Let her focus on the beauty and power of Luna's journey, finding solace and purpose in her role as a guide and guardian.\n\nThe climax of the chapter should be the breathtaking moment of Anky's birth. Capture the complex and overwhelming emotions that flood through Maria as she witnesses this miracle of new life. Let her joy and awe mingle with the bittersweet remembrance of her own loss, creating a poignant and deeply human moment. Show how Maria's own story of resilience and love allows her to be fully present for Luna in this transformative experience.\n\nAs the chapter closes, reflect on how Maria's journey \u2013 the love, the heartbreak, the healing \u2013 has led her to this sacred calling of supporting women through the most vulnerable and powerful experiences of their lives. Let her story stand as a testament to the transformative power of love, and how our deepest pain can become a source of strength, empathy, and connection. End with a sense of Maria's heart expanding, embracing the full spectrum of emotions that come with the journey of motherhood, and reaffirming her commitment to walk alongside women as they birth new life and new versions of themselves.\n</instructions>\n\n<style> The language should be evocative, poetic, and deeply emotional, capturing the raw intensity and beauty of birth and the complex, layered feelings it evokes. Use vivid sensory details to bring the birthing space to life, from the soft glow of candlelight to the earthy scent of essential oils. Maria's internal monologue should be rich and introspective, weaving together memories of her own experiences with her present observations and emotions. Her voice should be warm, wise, and compassionate, revealing both her strength and her vulnerability. The pacing of the chapter should ebb and flow with the rhythms of labor, building in intensity and emotion as Luna's journey progresses. The tone should be intimate and honest, inviting the reader into the sacred space of birth and the depths of Maria's heart. Employ metaphors and imagery that evoke the transformative power of birth and the cyclical nature of life, love, and loss. Let the language reflect the spiritual and emotional dimensions of the experience, while grounding it in the visceral, bodily reality of labor. </style> <setting> The birthing room should be portrayed as a sacred, liminal space \u2013 a place of transition and transformation. Describe the warm, soft lighting, the comfortable furnishings, and the carefully chosen elements that create a sense of safety and tranquility.\nAs Maria moves through this space, let it reflect her inner landscape \u2013 the memories, emotions, and insights that surface as she guides Luna through labor. The setting should be alive and dynamic, responding to the shifting energy and intensity of the birthing process.\n\nContrast the peaceful, nurturing environment of the birthing room with the stark, clinical details of Maria's memories of her own loss. Let the two spaces \u2013 one of creation, one of grief \u2013 intersect and overlap, mirroring Maria's internal journey of integrating her past pain with her present purpose.\n</setting>\n\n<characters> Maria: The emotional core of the chapter, Maria should be portrayed as a woman who has transformed her own suffering into a source of strength, compassion, and wisdom. Her interactions with Luna should reveal her deep capacity for empathy, her intuitive understanding of the birthing process, and her unwavering commitment to providing support and guidance. Maria's internal dialogue should be rich and multi-faceted, reflecting on her own journey of love, loss, and healing, and how it has shaped her identity and purpose as a doula.\nLuna: Though the chapter is told from Maria's perspective, Luna's presence should be vital and vividly felt. Her journey through labor should be the catalyst for Maria's own emotional and spiritual journey. Show Luna's strength, vulnerability, and trust in Maria, and how their bond deepens through the shared experience of birth.\n\nAnky: Though not yet born for most of the chapter, Anky's impending arrival should be a constant presence, a symbol of the miraculous power of life and the profound transformations that birth brings. Let the anticipation of her arrival infuse the chapter with a sense of awe, wonder, and possibility.\n\nThe spirit of Maria's lost child: While not a physical presence, the memory of Maria's own baby should be a poignant undercurrent throughout the chapter. Let this absent presence be felt in Maria's moments of grief, longing, and, ultimately, in her renewed sense of purpose and connection to the cycle of life.\n</characters><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe soft glow of dawn filters through the sheer curtains, casting a warm, golden light over the birthing room. I move through the space with practiced grace, my bare feet whispering against the polished wooden floor. Each mindful action is a ritual, a sacred preparation for the profound journey that lies ahead.\n\nAs I lay out the soft, woven blankets and arrange the pillows, my mind drifts to the significance of this space. It's more than just a room - it's a sanctuary, a sacred container for the transformative experience of birth. Each object I place holds a purpose, an intention to create an environment of comfort, safety, and warmth.\n\nMy hands smooth over the intricate patterns of the blanket, tracing the delicate threads. The fabric holds stories, ancient wisdom woven into its very fibers. Just as this blanket will swaddle and comfort the newborn child, this room will soon hold the story of Luna's birth, a tale of love, strength, and the power of the feminine spirit.\n\nAs I work, I find myself transported back to my own pregnancy, a time of boundless joy and dreams of the future. I remember the flutter of life within me, the whispered conversations with my unborn child as I went about my days. The love I felt then was all-encompassing, a fierce, protective force that seemed to emanate from my very pores.\n\nBut those dreams, like gossamer strands, were torn away too soon. I lost my child, my love, in a heartbeat, in a moment that shattered my world into a million irreconcilable pieces. The memory rises unbidden, a shadow that threatens to eclipse the light of the present.\n\nI pause, closing my eyes and breathing deeply. I allow myself to feel the weight of that loss, the ache that still throbs in the depths of my heart. But I don't push it away. Instead, I let it settle into my bones, into the very marrow of my being. For I have learned that it is only by embracing our shadows that we can truly step into the light.\n\nThe pain of my past has become the foundation of my strength, the bedrock of the compassion and wisdom I now offer to other women as they navigate the transformative journey of birth. It's a hard-won wisdom, born of the fire of my own experience, and it allows me to be a light for others in their moments of darkness.\n\nThe sound of the door opening pulls me from my reflections. Luna enters the birthing room, her hands resting gently on her swollen belly. In her eyes, I see a flicker of the same anticipation and trepidation I once felt - the exhilaration of impending motherhood tempered by a primal understanding of the immensity of the threshold she's about to cross.\n\nI approach Luna with a gentle smile, my movements fluid and grounded in the present moment. \"Welcome,\" I say softly, my voice a soothing ripple in the tranquil space. \"This is your sanctuary. Here, you are safe to let go, to surrender to the ancient wisdom of your body.\"\n\nLuna returns my smile, her shoulders relaxing slightly as she takes in the carefully prepared space. I guide her to the center of the room, where the woven blanket lies like an inviting oasis. As she settles onto it, I kneel beside her, my hands already reaching for the oil infused with lavender and frankincense.\n\nWith gentle, circular motions, I anoint Luna's skin, the scent of the oils mingling with the earthy sweetness of her own unique aroma. The lavender is for relaxation, to calm the mind and soothe the spirit. The frankincense is a sacred offering, a way of honoring the divine in this most human of experiences.\n\nAs I work, I feel Luna's body begin to relax, her breath deepening and slowing. It's a privilege to witness this, to be a part of this intimate, sacred process. Birth is a journey that requires immense trust - trust in oneself, trust in the process, and trust in those who hold space for you.\n\nThe first contraction takes Luna by surprise, her body tensing as the wave of intensity washes over her. I place my hand gently on her back, feeling the muscles tighten and release beneath my palm. \"Breathe,\" I murmur, my voice a steady anchor amidst the rising tide of sensation. \"Breathe into the space between the pain. Let it flow through you.\"\n\nLuna nods, her jaw clenched, her focus turning inward as she rides the crest of the contraction. I stay with her, my presence a silent assurance, a reminder that she is not alone in this journey.\n\nAs the labor progresses, I find myself drawing on the depths of my own experience, offering Luna the comfort and guidance that I wish I had had during my own birth. When the contractions grow more intense, when doubt and fear cloud her eyes, I meet her gaze with unwavering steadiness.\n\n\"You are strong,\" I tell her, my voice ringing with conviction. \"Your body knows what to do. Trust it. Trust yourself.\"\n\nAnd in those moments, as Luna digs deep within herself to find the strength to continue, I feel my own resolve fortify. Every birth is a healing, a chance to honor the path that has led me here.\n\nBut the path of a doula is not an easy one. As much as I strive to be a pillar of strength for the women I serve, there are moments when my own doubts and fears threaten to surface. When the echoes of my own loss ring loud in my ears, when the ghost of the child I never got to hold seems to linger at the edges of the room.\n\nIt's in one of these moments, as Luna is resting between contractions, that she turns to me, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. \"I'm scared,\" she confesses, her voice barely a whisper. \"What if I can't do this? What if something goes wrong?\"\n\nHer words strike a chord deep within me, resonating with my own deepest fears. For a moment, I'm back in my own birthing room, the deafening silence where my baby's cry should have been echoing in my ears.\n\nI take a shaky breath, reaching for Luna's hand and clasping it tightly in my own. \"I know,\" I murmur, my own voice thick with emotion. \"I remember my own fear, my own pain. When I lost my baby, it felt like my world had ended. I didn't know how I could possibly go on.\"\n\nLuna's eyes widen, a flicker of understanding passing between us. In that moment, our stories intertwine, our shared experience of love and loss binding us together in a way that transcends the roles of doula and mother.\n\n\"But here's what I've learned,\" I continue, my thumb rubbing gentle circles on the back of Luna's hand. \"The love we have for our children, whether they're with us on this earth or not, is a force greater than fear. It's a light that guides us through the darkest of times. And right now, that love is shining through you, Luna. It's giving you the strength to bring your baby into the world.\"\n\nTears spill down Luna's cheeks, but there's a new light in her eyes, a flicker of determination that wasn't there before. She nods, squeezing my hand in silent acknowledgment of the bond we share.\n\nAs the labor intensifies, as Luna begins to push with primal force, I find myself fighting to stay anchored in the present. The memories of my own birth, the crushing grief of my loss, rise like specters, threatening to pull me under.\n\nBut I focus on Luna, on the power and beauty of her struggle. I let her strength fuel my own, let her courage be the light that guides me through the shadows of my past.\n\nAnd then, with a final, guttural cry, Anky emerges into the world. I catch her in my hands, this tiny, perfect being, slick with the essence of life. Her first cry pierces the air, a triumphant declaration of existence, and in that moment, everything else falls away.\n\nI place Anky on Luna's chest, watching as mother and child meet each other for the first time. There's a sacredness to this moment, a profound intimacy that words can never fully capture. The love that flows between them is tangible, a living, breathing force that fills the room.\n\nAnd in the radiance of that love, I feel something within me shift, a subtle but seismic realignment. The knot of grief in my heart, the one I've carried with me since the day I lost my own child, begins to loosen. It's not a sudden erasure of pain, but a gentle easing, a sense of something hard and heavy beginning to transmute.\n\nFor in witnessing the pure, unconditional love between Luna and Anky, I am reminded of the love that once grew within me. The love that welcomed my own child, even though they never took a breath in this world. That love, I realize, has never left me. It has simply been waiting, patient and steadfast, for me to acknowledge its presence once more.\n\nAs I step back, allowing Luna and Anky to bask in the glow of their newfound connection, I feel a sense of profound gratitude wash over me. Gratitude for the privilege of being a part of this moment, of witnessing the miracle of new life emerging. Gratitude for my own journey, for the love and loss that have shaped me into the woman, the doula, I am today.\n\nIn the hours that follow, as I clean and clear the birthing space, I find myself reflecting on the larger tapestry of life - the intricate weave of joy and sorrow, love and loss, that makes up the human experience. Each object I put away - the oils, the blankets, the candles - is infused with the energy of Luna's birth, with the memory of Anky's first breath.\n\nThis, I realize, is the essence of my work, the heart of my calling. To hold space for the full spectrum of human experience, to offer comfort and guidance through the most profound and transformative moments of life. It's a sacred trust, a responsibility that I hold close to my heart.\n\nAs I prepare to leave, I pause at the threshold, my hand resting on the doorframe. The late afternoon sun streams through the windows, casting the room in a warm, golden glow. It's a moment of stillness, of quiet reflection before I step back out into the world.\n\nI think of Luna and Anky, resting together in the peaceful aftermath of birth. I think of all the women I've supported, all the births I've witnessed. Each one a unique thread in the vast tapestry of life, each one a reminder of the resilience and power of the feminine spirit.\n\nAnd I think of my own child, the one I hold in my heart rather than my arms. The love I have for them, the love that welcomed them into existence, has not diminished with time or loss. It has simply transformed, flowing now through my hands, my words, my presence as I guide other women through the sacred journey of birth.\n\nThis love, I now understand, is the foundation of my work, the bedrock of my own healing. It's what allows me to show up, fully and authentically, for the women I serve. It's what gives me the strength to face my own shadows, to alchemize my pain into purpose.\n\nAnd as I step out into the golden light of late afternoon, I feel my heart expand with a fierce, bittersweet ache. The loss of my child, the story of my own truncated journey into motherhood, will always be a part of me. But it no longer defines me.\n\nInstead, I choose to define myself by the love I bring into the world, by the light I offer to others in their moments of darkness. This is my story, my tapestry - woven of equal parts sorrow and joy, heartbreak and healing.\n\nI walk forward, rooted in the knowledge that this is my path, my purpose. To be a guardian of the threshold, a midwife to the soul. To bear witness to the raw, unfiltered beauty of life in all its shades.\n\nThe world stretches out before me, a canvas of infinite possibility. And with each step, each birth, each moment of connection and compassion, I add my own thread to the great, shimmering tapestry of existence.\n\nI am a doula, a woman, a healer. Shaped by love, forged by loss, and forever connected to the pulsing, primal heartbeat of life itself. In the space between breaths, in the sacred silence of a new soul unfurling, I find my own redemption, my own rebirth.\n\nAnd so the journey continues, a spiraling dance of endings and beginnings, of grief and grace, of sorrow and enduring, extraordinary love.<|im_end|>\n"]}
